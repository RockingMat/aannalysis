handed that he beat the manager into a coma in front of a bank full of people and you can imagine how my sister reacted when she heard this news well yes she was over the moon and even though I did n't get the contract I still think I put in the best bid oh well of course it would be just like you to disagree still I do n't care I really am happy for you it 's about time something went your way for a change especially all the trouble you seem to be having lately what with your gall bladder and all what that is n't you well who could it be then I could have sworn that Terry told me it was your gall bladder oh that was Terry 's gall bladder huh he 's dead well I never would have guessed that it was obviously much worse than any of us first thought well of course he 'd tell her first they were going out for the last seven years they have that kid you know Bronwyn I 've never really been able to get along with her she seems such a snot - nosed little one so how has the gold been coming along really off four now well you have been keeping that a little secret have n't you oh no I can barely play off ten you know me I only like to go nine rounds so I can practice my putting but I suppose it 's just the way it goes and by the way have you seen that new ad for the housing development over in the valley yes I know rather provocative but let me tell you something about provocation and no I 'm not talking about my sister again it 's that young boy that moved out of here a while back did you know that he took the worst part of that saying and splashed it clear across the back page of the world we once called our own but I do n't suppose that 's even the worst part I ca n't even begin to tell you and so we leave well enough there and mosey on to a new subtext because I truly am nearly finished here I just have to keep going keep placing words one in front of the other yes sort of like walking I guess I 'm walking the last steps of this marathon the end is in sight once again and I think it 's receding less than I first imagined in fact I 'm growing stronger with each line I type no matter how many mistakes I make no matter how many times I must use the backspace key to go over my sloppy typing I 'm certainly glad I do n't have to do this on a manual typewriter I would just about throw that through the window as it is it is only because I 'm almost finished that I do n't wreck this computer but naturally it 's not the computers fault it can only type what the useless operator is telling it too and for some reason that makes me glad because there is beauty in the ability to make a mistake there is something true soul about fucking up so badly man I think I 'm really coming to the end of this marathon experiment now I think I 'm really going to make it after all I made the mistake again of checking the word count and I was down to a bit over one thousand words so I figured that if I just kept typing and typing you know any old rubbish basically like the crap you are reading now then I 'd be able to get myself to thirty pages of text because I almost figured out in the toilet that around about thirty pages of text would constitute twenty - thousand words and here I am on page twenty - nine edging ever closer to the magical thirty page mark and it 's seven thirty - nine in the morning the sun is absolutely up and I 'm feeling fantastic I 've made it through the night constantly typing apart from a couple of toilet breaks and soon it will be time to wake my wife up and yes I am repeating myself I think I have basically repeated myself constantly for this whole book but right at this moment I could really care less I 'm nearly there I have no more to say but I 'm nearly there I can smell it I can hear the birds singing I can hear the trains leaving I can hear the cards starting up for work and I can hear my own heart singing it 's praise of hallelujah because it also knows that I 'm almost there I just need to cross the line now just need to cross the line step foot left right left right keep it going David keep it going the line is so close ca n't you feel it you 've just written that you can smell it so do n't stop now I can not believe this every time I think I 'm close to making it over the line I have to write another one look here we go again this is going to be the most pointless book I 've ever written at least till this line because I 'm into the thirty page mark now and so I will finish this mess and see how I 've gone .
