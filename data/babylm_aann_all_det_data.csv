memory address one thousand so it is a little overhead gives e additional information that you keep track so how do we do the next very similar kind of concept we say hey i'm going to create a new point okie i need some more memory into the heap says okay why everything off into a thousand eight was allocated so i mean allocates give you some more space in memory that's enough space to store another point which means i'm going to give you space for your instance variables px if you want your overhead notice this dx in p why are distinct from that kexin life this is the p x imp you watch they really instance variables if you want the second px and key white over here at the instance variables of p two very distinct thing so they have separate memory to store them and same thing when we return value that we're going to sign two key to what we're going to sign is the address it's the beginning of the space that we set aside the memory that we set aside for pty method up you know one thousand seats or one thousand say yes any questions about that and space for the same thing accepted to the heat is going down all those memories are given allocated to a new memory we need requires the keep to keep growing downward funky things right we're going to do a method call so we're going to say p one dot cmu we're going to do a method call when we do a method call what ends up happening is we're going to have some parameters and some local variables which means we're going to have to allocate some memory on the staff for that method call so when we start the map that call what ends up happening and we say hey key one i want you to move yourself by ten comm eleven so what actually happens in memory what happens in memory starting at this point upward is we create a new stack frame remember we talked about stack frame to be said when you call a method it sort of like the previous method of previous place you're running just get suspended we try to create this new frame on top that the contains all the information we drew little boxes for the variables and all that one week itself like tracing palindrome than all that happy news remember that if remember that night yeah what was going on underneath the hood it wasn't just nice and with the time it was nice pictures this is what was going on and meet the hood some memory was getting crated on the stack and that's why we refer to this as a stack frame it's keeping track of that frame of information for the method call and it doesn't on the staff of swatches factory what information goes on the stack frame while you get sent over head for the fact that you're calling a method for the earth is overhead as this first four bikes here you get all the parameters that you're passing to the map and you might say but here in the framers on passing through method or d why in the axe what's this in this thing of about there's a hidden parameter that you didn't know about until now now you know about it when i'm calling to method on a particular object how do i know which object won some actually getting into the details of things i actually called the method on and so when you make a method called on an object the very first thing after the overhead that gets put onto the stack essentially a pointer to the object it's what we are for tourism this point to remember we talked about that this pointer and we said this is basically a way for an object to a flirt with self when it's been called or how does it know how to reply to itself it needs to know where itself that's kinda we are in their own wiser optic need to know where it lives itself because when i write some acted these methods are not yet associate with particular objects that i created once i craved particular objects and call that method on them this method over here needs to know hey we're not doing these modifications on piak simply wife which piak simply why are you referring to that's where this comes in this set hey i'm going to tell you the place where the particular object lives whose method is being called so whatever modifications you make over here you know to make them for the object that lives at this addressed which is why it's called so when you make a method call the first thing you get is the address the particular object that remain the method call on right were making a method called he won in p one lives at of thousand right so if you want to just a thousand so this is the value of thousandth and then i get the parameters in reverse order because the sax going up right i get the axe first then i get do you watch and they were just at the value ten and eleven of the past and and i get copies of those down questions about that this pointer here's a graphics variables and when you can when you add up,77057,this first four bikes,DT JJ CD NNS,this,first,four,bikes,

0:00:52.110,0:00:55.970 sax first made his name is an economist in the early nineteen eighties 0:00:55.970,0:01:00.230 he wrote a series of papers on international trade exchange rates an 0:01:00.230,0:01:02.730 international policy coordination 0:01:02.730,0:01:05.030 and in the eighties he became tenure at harvard 0:01:05.030,0:01:08.190 as one of the youngest full professors at

which is online 0:01:15.729,0:01:16.460 it's called 0:01:16.460,0:01:20.150 economic reform in the process of global integration 0:01:20.150,0:01:24.490 and that paper he talks about by the opening up of economies to trade 0:01:24.490,0:01:29.079 is really is a prerequisite and driver of further policy reform 0:01:29.079,0:01:32.380 but although this work on international trade had a real impact 0:01:32.380,0:01:37.190 it's actually not what sex is best known for today 0:01:37.190,0:01:40.719 sax move more into the public eye in the mid nineteen eighties 0:01:40.719,0:01:42.389 with people living in reforms 0:01:42.389,0:01:45.440 especially the reforms against hyperinflation 0:01:45.440,0:01:49.350 in nineteen eighty five the government of bolivia asked fax if you would come 0:01:49.350,0:01:50.130 down 0:01:50.130,0:01:53.930 and help them with their economy and he came up with a comprehensive 0:01:53.930,0:01:57.670 fairly drastic plan for ending their hyperinflation and reforming their 0:01:57.670,0:01:58.860 economy 0:01:58.860,0:02:02.790 by no means did this plant fix all or even most of their problems 0:02:02.790,0:02:05.850 but it did help the bolivians and the hyperinflation 0:02:05.850,0:02:08.569 an overall it can be judged a success 0:02:08.569,0:02:12.549 it was a form of what later came to be called shock therapy 0:02:12.549,0:02:16.379 plans of this sort were based on tight controls over the money supply 0:02:16.379,0:02:17.689 freeing up prices 0:02:17.689,0:02:21.729 and liberalizing the economy 0:02:21.729,0:02:25.280 sexes connection to the so-called shock therapy continued 0:02:25.280,0:02:29.670 and indeed it intensified as eastern europe started to throw off communism 0:02:29.670,0:02:31.419 in the late nineteen eighties 0:02:31.419,0:02:35.239 at that point it was then necessary to have plans for reform 0:02:35.239,0:02:39.129 sax is added poland and he was very important there as an advisor and it's

0:02:47.949,0:02:51.879 namely the sense that in economy could and indeed should do a lot of things 0:02:51.879,0:02:52.879 upfront 0:02:52.879,0:02:53.829 very quickly 0:02:53.829,0:02:57.109 to re-establish a market economy right away 0:02:57.109,0:03:00.760 with the passage of time i would judge shock therapy in poland 0:03:00.760,0:03:03.399 actually two has been quite a success 0:03:03.399,0:03:07.450 lately poland has been growing rapidly and it really has joined the community 0:03:07.450,0:03:09.159 of western european nations 0:03:09.159,0:03:11.619 as a more or less equal partner 0:03:11.619,0:03:14.989 in russia the use of shock therapy was more controversial 0:03:14.989,0:03:18.209 because it was accompanied by a series of privatizations 0:03:18.209,0:03:20.130 which led to a lot of corruption 0:03:20.130,0:03:24.359 and redistributed wealth in a manner which many people consider unjust 0:03:24.359,0:03:25.680 in fairness to saks 0:03:25.680,0:03:27.439 these privatizations and russia 0:03:27.439,0:03:29.410 happened after he left the country 0:03:29.410,0:03:31.889 and stop serving there as an advisor 0:03:31.889,0:03:33.890 nonetheless the important point here 0:03:33.890,0:03:39.409 is that shock therapy remains a somewhat controversial concept 0:03:39.409,0:03:43.469 by the way if you'd like to read saxon shock therapy i recommend

problem of malaria is not only that it kills people 0:05:28.110,0:05:31.980 but also when you're young if you're infected by malaria it stunts your 0:05:31.980,0:05:33.100 physical growth

good judgment day here that's the case that families try to bill is that their judgment as bad a judgment as a cognitive area so now that the plane that they have memory problem and they got impaired judgment that's the diagnostic criteria for dementia the reason that this diagnosis is so prevalent is that physicians have the same problem that we have they like to get paid and for every treatment that they provide they have to have a diagnosis the coincides with that treatment what happens to be the case that what you guys know someone with senile dementia the alzheimer's type it opens the doors to a wide variety of treatments that need no additional diagnostic explanation so that diagnosis becomes a very efficient diagnosis for physicians to use and it's very unusual medicare despite the fact it feels to me that they try to find recent wire services were not medically necessary one of the diagnostic codes that they do allow psychotherapy to be provided for is senile dementia of the alzheimer skype now if it's true indicates that you are serving patients that really have senile dementia the alzheimer's tight and you're providing weekly psychotherapy this would be of the type that they get to meet you for the first time every single week what do you really think you're accomplishing here you know if i have a patient that truly has alzheimer's dementia i mainly with them a couple of times to make sure of the diagnosis and be supportive to the family but i'm going off the case because i don't think psychotherapy is applications for someone with moderate to severe dementia they've got to be another way to do this besides psychotherapy i just don't think it's a patient that medicare does pay fort generally start my progress notes by saying patient was alert naureen at times foreign demonstrated could carry over morning so that i'm documenting that even though the station as an alzheimer's diagnosis it's that special sub-type e_ c_ that they do have carryover working i do think there's some dementia out there it's not nearly as problem as you would think it is do not be swayed by the official diagnosis on the medical record because there will be a number of folks that have an outside worse diagnosis that when you do your revaluation you'll be under convinced that they truly have this so just because you're diagnosed as outside burst over a lot of psychotherapy candidates make your own evaluation diagnostic criteria for depression by the way i really don't need the glasses i'm just using them to sort of get myself into the mood of the topic so understand at least five of the following symptoms have been present during the same two week period and one of the symptoms as either depressed mood or loss of interest or pleasure the other symptoms significant weight loss or gain when not dieting significant defined as more than five percent of body weight now do be aware that sometimes in working with older adults you will be encouraging them to set goals and one of the first goals that they may set is to lose ten pounds and as you look at them it will occur to you that they have a to lose and you say well how do you plan on losing ten counts a one point ee plus an exercise more super so they set out on a goal to lose weight now once this nursing home residents has set out on a goal to lose weight and they've dropped five or six pounds you can expect the facility to step in and assist us by putting them on supplemental feedings appetite stimulants an extra portions now the reason for that is that when your client sets a goal to lose weight and does it they end up on a weight loss sheet and the statement comes in surveys the nursing home finds that there are no weight loss sheet and the state knows why people

facility that sets a weight loss cole make the director of nursing and the dietitian aware of what's going on and cover it heavily in your notes that way when the state comes in and says why is she on the weight loss chic the facility can say i'll because doctor tom helper set a goal to lose weight it's in his notes that that's what's going on and the state will say okay for you that otherwise you got to get your facilities cleared otherwise the facilities are going to fight against the school and then that becomes one more example to your older adult client that sure enough when i try to do

alligators suny they're sworn enemies the one-time iran helped us over the last ten years was when we went into afghanistan 'cause they want to also wiped out al-qaeda which was one of their top

0:01:19.780,0:01:21.500 this is not situation 0:01:21.500,0:01:24.130 terrible assumption particularly the first part 0:01:24.130,0:01:27.860 so lot of ideas already public good so for example 0:01:27.860,0:01:31.590 a force is equal a mass times acceleration the pipetter npr_ news a 0:01:31.590,0:01:32.640 public goods 0:01:32.640,0:01:34.340 available to everyone 0:01:34.340,0:01:37.840 however the second assumption is really problematic 0:01:37.840,0:01:38.970 because 0:01:38.970,0:01:41.570 growth is about new ideas 0:01:41.570,0:01:43.700 and if you look around in the world 0:01:43.700,0:01:48.590 most research and development is produced by for-profit firms 0:01:48.590,0:01:51.929 growth ideas are not coming out of the ether 0:01:51.929,0:01:54.260 they're not just arriving 0:01:54.260,0:01:55.450 magically 0:01:55.450,0:01:58.210 they happen in some places and not in other places 0:01:58.210,0:02:00.030 and they happen for a reason 0:02:00.030,0:02:01.479 the happened because 0:02:01.479,0:02:06.420 most of the time someone is out to make a profit in developed economies 0:02:06.420,0:02:09.360 sixty to eighty percent of research and development 0:02:09.360,0:02:13.439 is privately produced by for-profit firms 0:02:13.439,0:02:17.349 so however made these assumptions for a reason 0:02:17.349,0:02:21.549 he made these assumptions because the made the model much much simpler 0:02:21.549,0:02:26.219 because with these assumptions ideas are freely available literally free 0:02:26.219,0:02:27.619 they're not priced 0:02:27.619,0:02:31.879 that means that capital and labor can be sold in competitive markets 0:02:31.879,0:02:34.450 the candidates receive their marginal product 0:02:34.450,0:02:38.200 the product itself can be sold a competitive markets and the payments to 0:02:38.200,0:02:39.450 capitol labor 0:02:39.450,0:02:43.679 will nicely sum up to exactly equal the price of the product 0:02:43.679,0:02:46.469 sort everything works out beautifully with 0:02:46.469,0:02:49.879 the competitive firms that when ideas are not 0:02:49.879,0:02:51.349 uh... priced 0:02:51.349,0:02:52.279 however 0:02:52.279,0:02:54.240 when ideas are priced 0:02:54.240,0:02:55.350 we have a problem 0:02:55.350,0:02:56.809 let's take a look 0:02:56.809,0:02:59.089 ideas are non rival wrist 0:02:59.089,0:03:03.169 and it cannot be sold in competitive markets because the marginal cost is 0:03:03.169,0:03:04.260 zero 0:03:04.260,0:03:08.769 so the classic example here is the pharmaceutical the first pill cost a 0:03:08.769,0:03:10.040 billion dollars 0:03:10.040,0:03:12.349 the second door cost fifty cents 0:03:12.349,0:03:14.319 that fifty cents 0:03:14.319,0:03:17.749 that can be produced the second film the third the fourth in the fifth 0:03:17.749,0:03:22.329 and the end and the and fill can be produced in competitive markets 0:03:22.329,0:03:24.120 the fifty cents comes from 0:03:24.120,0:03:27.189 payments a kaplan labor which are just enough 0:03:27.189,0:03:31.139 to cover the fifty-cent cost of the product 0:03:31.139,0:03:34.969 that doesn't lead and i think over for producing the formula 0:03:34.969,0:03:37.799 for producing the idea which made the 0:03:37.799,0:03:41.169 pharmaceutical possible in the first place 0:03:41.169,0:03:45.739 so you can't sell pharmaceuticals in competitive markets 0:03:45.739,0:03:46.739 okay 0:03:46.739,0:03:49.330 because that doesn't leave enough left over 0:03:49.330,0:03:53.050 to funded the research and development which went into producing a product of 0:03:53.050,0:03:54.249 the first place 0:03:54.249,0:03:56.999 there has to be some in our police power 0:03:56.999,0:04:00.069 either the monopoly power maybe comes from a patent 0:04:00.069,0:04:03.969 or maybe comes from being first a market or having a trade secret 0:04:03.969,0:04:07.759 or having some knowledge of being able to do things better than other people do 0:04:07.759,0:04:09.929 but you need some monopoly power 0:04:09.929,0:04:13.309 uh... to find to fund these ideas 0:04:13.309,0:04:15.589 ideas also create spillovers 0:04:15.589,0:04:19.840 even when you have monopoly power well the pattern runs out over time 0:04:19.840,0:04:23.020 the idea of the at the idea of self can be copied 0:04:23.020,0:04:24.669 not directly but can be 0:04:24.669,0:04:27.430 uh... uh... the idea comes to be useful 0:04:27.430,0:04:29.599 can still spread around the world 0:04:29.599,0:04:31.089 so what'd romer do 0:04:31.089,0:04:35.060 but what romer ddc_ created a mold growth based on ideas 0:04:35.060,0:04:38.240 which were privately produced by for-profit firms 0:04:38.240,0:04:41.100 in annapolis tically competitive markets 0:04:41.100,0:04:44.639 with spillovers 0:04:44.639,0:04:46.389 in one way that's just 0:04:46.389,0:04:50.399 following the formula bestest doing exactly what we would hope a model 0:04:50.399,0:04:51.300 should do 0:04:51.300,0:04:52.719 but bear in mind 0:04:52.719,0:04:55.370 that everyone knew this was kind of the right way to go 0:04:55.370,0:04:59.700 everyone knew this was the right model but apparel failed to create this model 0:04:59.700,0:05:02.009 samuelson failed to create this model 0:05:02.009,0:05:05.959 solo failed to create this model it wasn't until romer 0:05:05.959,0:05:08.149 that all the knots were tied 0:05:08.149,0:05:12.219 that we have all of these characteristics which we know are true 0:05:12.219,0:05:13.990 that ideas are produced by 0:05:13.990,0:05:18.529 monopolistic firms that idea is a really important in growth 0:05:18.529,0:05:23.150 ideas have spillovers all of these ideas combined in a model 0:05:23.150,0:05:24.369 that was really is 0:05:24.369,0:05:27.219 romer response a prima congressman 0:05:27.219,0:05:31.050 in this paper of nineteen ninety 0:05:31.050,0:05:34.210 i said the model is a real technical achievement 0:05:34.210,0:05:35.439 that's true 0:05:35.439,0:05:39.159 but the really important aspect is that a common solvent on start to think about 0:05:39.159,0:05:41.660 things until we have a model 0:05:41.660,0:05:43.279 and what romer did 0:05:43.279,0:05:46.669 is he put ideas at the heart of growth theory 0:05:46.669,0:05:51.189 and once you do that you start to open up and start thinking about a lot of new 0:05:51.189,0:05:51.919 things 0:05:51.919,0:05:53.650 back in the solo model 0:05:53.650,0:05:56.709 it's all about the economic should capital 0:05:56.709,0:05:59.300 once you have ideas at the heart of the model 0:05:59.300,0:06:02.679 you start thinking about things like patents and intellectual property 0:06:02.679,0:06:04.729 you starting about universities 0:06:04.729,0:06:09.740 bug capital markets like venture capitalists and having a capital market 0:06:09.740,0:06:14.669 strong capital markets have been on two printers can take their firms 0:06:14.669,0:06:16.510 he's talking about human capital 0:06:16.510,0:06:19.450 and whiny might not have enough human capital 0:06:19.450,0:06:20.699 in research 0:06:20.699,0:06:22.949 why research might be under-funded 0:06:22.949,0:06:27.150 because we get spillovers because that's a monopolistic industry 0:06:27.150,0:06:29.560 you start asking yourselves questions about 0:06:29.560,0:06:31.569 why do some ideas 0:06:31.569,0:06:35.680 uh... how do ideas transmit themselves across the world how to be flow across 0:06:35.680,0:06:36.849 the world 0:06:36.849,0:06:38.350 where two ideas begin 0:06:38.350,0:06:40.789 why is it takes some ideas a long time 0:06:40.789,0:06:41.949 to transmit 0:06:41.949,0:06:45.270 and other ideas move across the world quite quickly 0:06:45.270,0:06:47.439 you get a whole new perspective on trade 0:06:47.439,0:06:49.569 and the importance of market size 0:06:49.569,0:06:50.319 as 0:06:50.319,0:06:53.940 generating the incentives to produce rnd_ 0:06:53.940,0:06:55.250 you begin to think about 0:06:55.250,0:06:57.199 differences in times of ideas 0:06:57.199,0:06:58.830 by technologies 0:06:58.830,0:07:02.209 these seem much more amenable to be communicated across 0:07:02.209,0:07:03.479 different countries 0:07:03.479,0:07:04.919 then do rules 0:07:04.919,0:07:08.849 rules by rules i mean things like how do people interact 0:07:08.849,0:07:10.349 rules on boat 0:07:10.349,0:07:13.789 uh... 0:07:13.789,0:07:15.939 rosalie had a greater corporation 0:07:15.939,0:07:17.969 how to create honest government 0:07:17.969,0:07:20.130 rules like 0:07:20.130,0:07:21.119 democracy 0:07:21.119,0:07:22.599 the rule of law 0:07:22.599,0:07:24.150 uh... honest judges 0:07:24.150,0:07:26.930 judges and separated from 0:07:26.930,0:07:29.599 uh... politicians the separation of powers 0:07:29.599,0:07:33.220 much harder to transmit these ideas and have these ideas adopted 0:07:33.220,0:07:36.259 than it is to have ideas about 0:07:36.259,0:07:39.030 how to create an engine for an ample 0:07:39.030,0:07:42.289 you also begin to think about where ideas are current 0:07:42.289,0:07:45.419 what is necessary to create new ideas you think about cities 0:07:45.419,0:07:49.800 you think about density of getting people close together to transmit 0:07:49.800,0:07:51.919 knowledge do you think about networks 0:07:51.919,0:07:53.050 so all of these 0:07:53.050,0:07:56.509 ideas about ideas were introduced 0:07:56.509,0:07:58.250 by the romer model and put 0:07:58.250,0:08:03.630 at the center of grocery bipolar world 0:08:03.630,0:08:07.020 so in the late nineteen eighties romer could produce a number of papers in new 0:08:07.020,0:08:08.249 growth theory 0:08:08.249,0:08:11.389 culminating in this great nineteen ninety paper 0:08:11.389,0:08:14.809 many people thought he was on the tracked for nobel prize 0:08:14.809,0:08:17.830 which he may yet winds are really in my view 0:08:17.830,0:08:20.740 and then something strange happened 0:08:20.740,0:08:22.680 romer disappeared 0:08:22.680,0:08:24.819 or at least it seemed that way too 0:08:24.819,0:08:27.669 many people in the economics profession 0:08:27.669,0:08:29.759 romer actually gave up tenure 0:08:29.759,0:08:31.410 he gave up tenure at stanford 0:08:31.410,0:08:34.610 he took an extended five-year leave of absence 0:08:34.610,0:08:36.000 from stanford 0:08:36.000,0:08:37.220 to do what 0:08:37.220,0:08:39.950 well romer created startup 0:08:39.950,0:08:41.670 he created an applicant 0:08:41.670,0:08:47.880 which long before it became a buzzword that it is now aplia was the beginnings 0:08:47.880,0:08:50.160 of online education 0:08:50.160,0:08:54.980 out there was a homework solution professors could assign quizzes could 0:08:54.980,0:08:59.980 grade all ur homework online could you experiments online in economics they 0:08:59.980,0:09:02.720 could shift a demand curve students could shift in anchorage 0:09:02.720,0:09:04.210 and supply curves 0:09:04.210,0:09:06.060 you know it was a fantastic 0:09:06.060,0:09:09.320 fantastic uh... device 0:09:09.320,0:09:10.730 and very successful 0:09:10.730,0:09:11.459 uh... 0:09:11.459,0:09:15.139 uh... roma ran out the effort that seven years and then so look for a lot of 0:09:15.139,0:09:16.470 money to send age 0:09:16.470,0:09:20.670 out they are still going strong today 0:09:20.670,0:09:23.940 did a rumor leave new growth theory 0:09:23.940,0:09:26.920 did he take the lessons of new growth theory 0:09:26.920,0:09:28.829 the importance of ideas 0:09:28.829,0:09:32.800 the importance of ideas to create new ideas to increase productivity 0:09:32.800,0:09:34.690 in dat apply those lessons 0:09:34.690,0:09:36.500 to a great start up 0:09:36.500,0:09:37.850 i think the latter 0:09:37.850,0:09:42.180 and romer story was not yet 0:09:42.180,0:09:46.620 most recently rumors come up with a startling new idea for development 0:09:46.620,0:09:48.040 charter cities 0:09:48.040,0:09:49.070 what is this 0:09:49.070,0:09:51.140 well let's go back to the problem 0:09:51.140,0:09:54.430 the problem is the iron rule of rules 0:09:54.430,0:09:56.610 well i mean my this is 0:09:56.610,0:10:00.940 that we saw that some rules things like the rule of law things like 0:10:00.940,0:10:04.150 anti corruption things like honesty in government 0:10:04.150,0:10:07.430 these types of rules are hard to transmit 0:10:07.430,0:10:09.240 now why the hard to transmit 0:10:09.240,0:10:13.210 well they may be hard to transmit because the require a lot of interaction 0:10:13.210,0:10:15.000 and a lot of coordination 0:10:15.000,0:10:16.620 it's kind of like getting everyone 0:10:16.620,0:10:20.540 from driving on the left hand side of the road to switch to driving on the 0:10:20.540,0:10:22.190 right-hand side of the road 0:10:22.190,0:10:25.500 everyone must agree to coordinate on the new equilibrium 0:10:25.500,0:10:27.300 and that's really hard 0:10:27.300,0:10:28.940 there may be forces 0:10:28.940,0:10:31.920 you can you do it you know halfway in halfway steps 0:10:31.920,0:10:33.819 he can do it a little bit of the time 0:10:33.819,0:10:35.890 you've gotta go all the way or nothing 0:10:35.890,0:10:37.700 and that is very very difficult 0:10:37.700,0:10:40.300 sweden by the way we actually managed to do this 0:10:40.300,0:10:42.200 in the nineteen seventies 0:10:42.200,0:10:45.740 so in just the same way that it's hard to get people to coordinate 0:10:45.740,0:10:48.130 on switching from the right hand side to that 0:10:48.130,0:10:50.130 left hand side or vice versa 0:10:50.130,0:10:52.419 it may be hard to get people to coordinate 0:10:52.419,0:10:54.520 out of the corruption trap 0:10:54.520,0:10:56.600 once you become 0:10:56.600,0:10:58.769 on known once once the rules 0:10:58.769,0:11:00.320 of helping out your cousin 0:11:00.320,0:11:04.420 of helping out your try member once that rule becomes laid down 0:11:04.420,0:11:07.380 a single person breaking from that rule 0:11:07.380,0:11:10.850 is going to have a really hard time they're going to be squash right back 0:11:10.850,0:11:12.960 down again if you don't help by your cousin 0:11:12.960,0:11:14.560 you can read thrown out of the family 0:11:14.560,0:11:17.780 it's really hard to break out of these coordination traps 0:11:17.780,0:11:19.450 so how do you do it 0:11:19.450,0:11:22.260 told the solution is startups 0:11:22.260,0:11:27.530 or a big push in ideas this is like the big push idea coming back to us again 0:11:27.530,0:11:28.959 but now it's and ideas 0:11:28.959,0:11:30.440 well i mean exactly 0:11:30.440,0:11:33.160 well what i mean what rawr means is 0:11:33.160,0:11:35.550 to start up a new city 0:11:35.550,0:11:38.399 and new city on on occupied land 0:11:38.399,0:11:40.280 with a charter of new 0:11:40.280,0:11:41.870 rules 0:11:41.870,0:11:44.170 toys he has in mind for these new rules 0:11:44.170,0:11:46.640 well he wants the rules to come from outside 0:11:46.640,0:11:48.810 to launched this new equilibrium 0:11:48.810,0:11:52.370 so for example you take a unoccupied piece of land 0:11:52.370,0:11:54.060 in a developed

uh... canada 0:12:01.390,0:12:03.260 over to great britain 0:12:03.260,0:12:07.280 uh... and have them apply this new set of rules and then have people 0:12:07.280,0:12:09.720 voluntarily enter the city 0:12:09.720,0:12:13.060 voluntarily put themselves under the new set of rules 0:12:13.060,0:12:14.500 hong kong here 0:12:14.500,0:12:16.390 is the classic example 0:12:16.390,0:12:18.870 remember it was hong kong 0:12:18.870,0:12:20.160 which is actually 0:12:20.160,0:12:22.620 completely revolutionized 0:12:22.620,0:12:26.050 and that's what rumors hoping start up a new city 0:12:26.050,0:12:26.940 created 0:12:26.940,0:12:28.490 not only as a 0:12:28.490,0:12:31.550 and in itself is a demonstration project 0:12:31.550,0:12:36.360 new city of ten million people are so operating under completely new rules 0:12:36.360,0:12:39.170 new rules which have been successful elsewhere 0:12:39.170,0:12:41.220 bring them to the new city 0:12:41.220,0:12:44.720 now romer introduced this idea only in two thousand and ten or so it's very 0:12:44.720,0:12:51.100 recent and yet incredibly he's already had some success in pushing the idea 0:12:51.100,0:12:52.600 uh... around the world 0:12:52.600,0:12:55.330 so what still hung juries for example 0:12:55.330,0:13:00.510 has indicated that it will create in fact has created 0:13:00.510,0:13:05.330 unoccupied piece of land where these new rules could be put in place right now 0:13:05.330,0:13:06.020 uh... 0:13:06.020,0:13:08.970 romer is looking for a third party 0:13:08.970,0:13:10.500 to come in and help 0:13:10.500,0:13:14.230 run the new city that canada is one possibility 0:13:14.230,0:13:18.950 he's got the judges from outside also being willing to come in and apply the 0:13:18.950,0:13:20.380 new rules 0:13:20.380,0:13:22.850 now bear in mind here something really important 0:13:22.850,0:13:27.270 and that is that the world is organizing and he really fast rate 0:13:27.270,0:13:31.650 so take india for example a scud eight hundred million people are settled still 0:13:31.650,0:13:36.260 living a rulings instance but it's clear over the next twenty to thirty years 0:13:36.260,0:13:39.960 hundreds of millions of these people are going to be coming to cities many of 0:13:39.960,0:13:41.650 them new cities 0:13:41.650,0:13:44.880 so now is a great opportunity 0:13:44.880,0:13:50.600 to create fresh new cities sees not beholden to the old rules 0:13:50.600,0:13:51.920 cities for example 0:13:51.920,0:13:54.840 were cast would no longer be recognized 0:13:54.840,0:13:56.490 that releases the hope 0:13:56.490,0:14:02.190 will roar be successful who knows but it's a bold idea his revolutionized 0:14:02.190,0:14:05.670 economics education he revolutionized new growth theory 0:14:05.670,0:14:10.010 perhaps this idea is gonna take off as well 0:14:10.010,0:14:13.750 here's a couple places you can find out more about pablo mur 0:14:13.750,0:14:17.860 particularly about this

but 0:14:33.500,0:14:36.580 those papers were absolutely revolutionary 0:14:36.580,0:14:38.580 and romer is the same way 0:14:38.580,0:14:42.380 he hasn't written a lot but he what he has written has been very deep has been 0:14:42.380,0:14:46.980 very fundamental has been much more important than a lot than most other 0:14:46.980,0:14:49.600 work which goes on in economics 0:14:49.600,0:14:54.150 indeed when i think about the economist which of most influenced me 0:14:54.150,0:14:56.650 when i think about the ideas which i 0:14:56.650,0:15:01.210 think about most on an everyday basis which are

The two queries partition the vertex set into 4 subsets: vertices reached by both, either one, or none of the searches.

When Jackson's departure had previously been rumored in 1996, Anthony Geary (Luke) told ""TV Guide"" that he ""went to (the ""GH"" powers) and said, 'If we lose him, then let's kill Lucky.' Jonathan is too much a part of us to replace him."" Geary repeated these sentiments when Jackson confirmed leaving in 1999. When a recast was rumored in early 2000, Jackson stated: ""When all the actors who are going to be working with the character don't want it, it's kind of too bad that they still do it. But I don't really get surprised with a lot of things that they do."" The role was recast with Jacob Young, and by the time he appeared on-screen in February 2000, the character had been off-screen for almost a year, speculated to be an attempt to ease the transition between actors due to Jackson's popularity. Young was able to become accepted by fans; in 2001, Candace Havens wrote in ""The Free Lance–Star"": ""His hard work has paid off and many fans can't even remember there was ever someone else in the role."" Young was named Sexiest Soap Star by ""People"" magazine in 2001. In 2002, Young won a Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Younger Actor. Greg Vaughan, who took over the role from 2003 to 2009, was the only portrayer of Lucky not to be nominated for an Emmy award. However, Vaughan did have a fan following. He was chosen by ABC Daytime and SOAPnet to participate in their 2008 Hot Guys Calendar, featuring popular male costars from ABC soap operas. At the start of 2008, ""Zap2it"" named Vaughan No. 6 on their Top 10 Most Improved list, stating: ""The gorgeous Mr. Vaughan plays angry and sexy very well. Thank goodness we're getting to see it."" During Vaughan's tenure, Lucky entered into a relationship with Sam McCall (Kelly Monaco) that was popular with fans. ""Zap2it"" named them No. 6 on their list of Top Couples of 2007, and tied them for No. 3 in 2008 along with entangled couple Elizabeth (Herbst) and Jason Morgan (Steve Burton), stating: ""[Lucky and Sam were] conceived out of a revenge plot, yet quickly surprised fans and execs alike with their instant chemistry. Is the Quad in for another partner-switching shake-up in 2009?"" When Vaughan left in 2009, he reflected on his reception: ""I am grateful as to how the fans embraced me, whether they liked me or not. It was my job to win them over and I did that in due time."" Some felt Vaughan was not a good fit for the character.

During this time, he lived in Foras lane, in the center of Bombay's red light area of Kamathipura. What he saw then around him had a profound impact on his writings. Subsequently Manto had also accepted the job of writing for Urdu Service of All India Radio in 1941. This proved to be his most productive period as in the next eighteen months he published over four collections of radio plays, Aao (Come), Manto ke Drame (Manto's Dramas), Janaze (Funerals) and Teen Auraten (Three women). He continued to write short stories and his next short story collection Dhuan (Smoke) was soon out followed by Manto ke Afsane and his first collection of topical essays, Manto ke Mazamin. This period culminated with the publication of his mixed collection Afsane aur Dramey in 1943. Meanwhile, due to a quarrel with the director of the All India Radio, poet N. M. Rashid, he left his job and returned to Bombay in July 1942 and again started working with film industry.

wikipedia,"Even though the poem is a mere nineteen lines there are many differing interpretations. The before-mentioned is the most popular interpretation. One of the others is that the word ""Eadwacer"" in the poem is not a proper noun, but a simple common noun which means ""property watcher"". This brings the characters in the poem from three to two, the speaker and her lover, Wulf. If one adopts this interpretation then her exclamation (""Do you hear me, Eadwacer?"") could be meant to be sarcastic or a calling out of his manhood. She is saying that his long absences have made him anything but a protector to her and their child who she worries about. Using this interpretation, the speaker's use of irony when speaking of her lover makes the last two lines make sense. The speaker may be saying that Wulf has been her lover and her child's father, but has never treated her as or actually been her husband. Therefore, the complications of their relationship is easily unbound.

Failure to use one's gifts, the parable suggests, will result in negative judgment. From a psychological point of view, the failure is the immediate result of the failure of feeling God's love.

wikipedia,"The seventh Treaty was signed in September 1877 between the Canadian government and the five First Nations: the Siksika (Blackfoot), Kainai (Blood), Piikani (Peigan), Stoney-Nakoda, and Tsuut’ina (Sarcee). Treaty seven was the last of a series of treaties that were signed during the 1870’s. It would be the last treaty signed between the Government and the First Nations for the next 20 years. This series of treaties during the 1870’s between the Canadian Government and the First Nation people was to determine the division of land. The negotiations of the treaty took place between lieutenant-governor of the North-West Territories, David Laird and James Macleod, commissioner of NWMP who were representing the Canadian Government. The First Nations representatives were largely from the Blackfoot confederacy due to their inhabiting the majority of the land being sought after. The First Nations' representative was the Blackfoot nation who sent Crowfoot to make the negotiations on their behalf. The signing of the treaty took place at the Blackfoot crossing, a location on their territory. This location was a bit problematic for some of the other nations due to it being quite far from their hunting grounds. The distance factor led to the meeting to discuss the negotiations being pushed back by two days. The treaty commissioners, David Laird and James Macleod arrived September 16 along with the Siksika, Stoney-Nakoda and Tsuut’ina. They all agreed to wait two days for the remaining nations to arrive. On September 19 the negotiations began between the commissioners and the Five nations. David Laird and James Macleod who were representing the Canadian government began their side of the negotiations with stating the facts about the decline in the buffalo population and how he proposed to help the Indigenous people by introducing new laws to protect the buffalo. The importance of the buffalo to the Indigenous people was high due to their dependence on the buffalo for food. David Laird proposed new laws to protect the buffalo along with helping and teaching the Indigenous people how to learn more about agriculture and ranching that would allow a way to transition from becoming less dependent on the buffalo. David Laird stated to the Indigenous people that the buffalo would soon be gone and it was important for them to move into agriculture and ranching lifestyles and that the government would support them for doing this. There was also discussion surround annual payments, reserve land and education. The Indigenous leaders and their nations were greatly concerned about continuing to be able to hunt and fish across all of the land. Crowfoot waited for the arrival of Red Crow, the leader of the Kainai Nation and a trusted friend of James Macleod before making any decisions with the treaty. Once Red Crow arrived Crowfoot explained to him to the best of his abilities about what he believed the treaty to be about. Once Crowfoot explained to Red Crow, to the best of his abilities, about the treaty and its terms, the treaty was agreed upon by all the leaders and was signed on September 22, 1877. The treaty involved 130,00 km of land stretching from the Rocky Mountains to the Cypress Hills, the Red Deer River and the US border. The terms of the treaty stated that all nations still maintained the right to hunt on the land and in exchange for giving up the land each nation was to receive “ land equal to 2.59 m2 per family of five and in proportion to that number depending on whether the family was larger or smaller”. Along with the exchange of land an immediate payment was given to every man, woman and child and the promise of annual payments of 25 dollars to the nations chief. The government also agreed to pay the salaries of the teachers on the reserves. The last agreement was that each family would be given livestock proportion to their family size. These were the terms agreed upon in exchange for the Indigenous people's land. There is very strong evidence to support that the Indigenous people did not understand that they were surrendering their land to the government.",24980,the next 20 years,DT JJ CD NNS,the,next,20,years,

The second Sangam lasted for 3,700 years in a city called Kapatapuram, attended by 59 poets (including Agastya, again).

This is the most widely accepted interpretation of the ancient sources thus when two phalanx formations engaged, the struggle essentially became a pushing match. Historians such as Victor Davis Hanson point out that it is difficult to account for exceptionally deep phalanx formations unless they were necessary to facilitate the physical pushing depicted by this theory, as those behind the first two ranks could not take part in the actual spear thrusting.",36343,the first two ranks,DT JJ CD NNS,the,first,two,ranks,
wikipedia,"The phalanx of the Ancient Macedonian kingdom and the later Hellenistic successor states was a development of the hoplite phalanx. The 'phalangites' were armed with a much longer spear, the sarissa, and less heavily armoured. The sarissa was the pike used by the ancient Macedonian army. Its actual length is unknown, but apparently it was twice as long as the dory. This makes it at least , but appears more likely. (The cavalry xyston was by comparison.) The great length of the pike was balanced by a counterweight at the rear end, which also functioned as a butt-spike, allowing the sarissa to be planted into the ground. Because of its great length, weight and different balance, a sarissa was wielded two-handed. This meant that the aspis was no longer a practical defence. Instead, the phalangites strapped a smaller pelte shield (usually reserved for peltasts, light skirmishers) to their left forearm. Recent theories, including examination of ancient frescoes depicting full sets of weapons and armor, claim that the shields used were actually larger than the pelte but smaller than the aspis, hanging by leather strap(s) from the left shoulder or from both shoulders. The shield would retain handling straps in the inner curve, to be handled like a (smaller) aspis if the fight progressed to sword-wielding. Although in both shield size assumptions this reduced the shield wall, the extreme length of the spear kept the enemy at a greater distance, as the pikes of the first three to five ranks could all be brought to bear in front of the front row. This pike had to be held underhand, as the shield would have obscured the soldier's vision had it been held overhead. It would also be very hard to remove a sarissa from anything it stuck in (the earth, shields, and soldiers of the opposition) if it were thrust downwards, due to its length. The Macedonian phalanx was much less able to form a shield wall, but the lengthened spears would have compensated for this.

Air Force pilots were hampered by use of the outdated ""fluid four"" tactical formations (a four-plane, two element formation in which only the leader did the shooting and in which the outside wingmen were vulnerable) dictated by service doctrine. Also contributing to the parity was a lack of air combat training against dissimilar aircraft, a deficient early warning system, and ECM pod formations that mandated strict adherence to formation flying. During August, however, the introduction of real-time early warning systems, increased aircrew combat experience, and degraded North Vietnamese ground control interception capabilities reversed the trend to a more favorable 4:1 kill ratio.",39032,the first two months,DT JJ CD NNS,the,first,two,months,

The 1980s saw Canada support and promote many of its own talent in pursuit of true originality. Canadian rock generally had been discouraged by market forces before the 1980s, in particular the need to conform to the taste of a Canadian audience that has had its standards and expectations formed by constant exposure to US and British acts for the prior three decades. The popularity of Chilliwack, for example, rose dramatically after the band turned from the experimental nature of its first few LPs to a mainstream pop style consistent with the US style.

Since the 1930s, it has been a journal for statistical theory and methodology. Galton's role in the journal was essentially that of a patron and the journal was run by Pearson and Weldon and after Weldon's death in 1906 by Pearson alone until he died in 1936. In the early days, the American biologists Charles Davenport and Raymond Pearl were nominally involved but they dropped out. On Pearson's death his son Egon Pearson became editor and remained in this position until 1966. David Cox was editor for the next 25 years.

Caesarion, now Ptolemy XV, reigned for a mere eighteen days until he was executed on the orders of Octavian on 29 August 30 BC. He had been returning to Alexandria under the false pretense that Octavian would allow him to be king. Octavian hesitated to have him killed at first, but the advice of philosopher and friend Arius Didymus convinced him there was room for only one Caesar in the world. With the fall of the Ptolemaic Kingdom, Egypt was made into a Roman province. This marked the end of Hellenistic Egypt and the entire Hellenistic age that had begun with the reign of Alexander the Great (336–323 BC) of Macedon. In January 27 BC Octavian was renamed Augustus ('the revered') and amassed constitutional powers that established him as the first Roman emperor, inaugurating the Principate era of the Roman Empire. Roman emperors were thereafter considered pharaohs of Egypt, but unlike the Ptolemaic rulers they did not reside in Egypt. Octavian, now Augustus, distanced himself from Egyptian royal rituals, such as coronation in the Egyptian style or worshiping the Apis bull. He was, however, depicted in Egyptian temples as a typical pharaoh making sacrifices to the gods. Unlike regular Roman provinces, Octavian established Egypt as territory under his personal control.

Initially, the four-cylinder had a single front disc and spoked wheels. A 3.00-18 front tire was used, and, depending on circuit, a 3.25, 3.50 or 3.75-18 rear tyre. It was a difficult year for MV Agusta and especially so for Giacomo Agostini. They had attracted Phil Read as ""second driver"", but he did not accept a supporting role.

Gianfranco Bonera broke a leg during the preseason and had to be replaced by Armando Toracca. Giacomo Agostini, sought rapprochement with the MV team, but was still employed by Yamaha. Toracca disliked ""second driver"" status and forced Read to fight for third place in the opening race, causing them to lose a lot of time to Agostini and Kanaya with their Yamahas. In Austria, Read was only third behind Kanaya and Länsivuori (Suzuki). On the Hockenheim circuit, pure speed was important and as a result Read was able to compete with Agostini, but Agostini won. In Imola, Read had no chance against Agostini and in Assen he was only third. In Belgium, another speed circuit, Read won. Moreover, Agostini dropped out, as did the now fit Bonera and Barry Sheene.

A person who collected copyrighted works that would soon ""go out of copyright,"" intending to re-release them on copyright expiration, lost the use of his capital expenditures for an additional 20 years when the Bono Act passed. This is part of the underlying argument in ""Eldred v. Ashcroft"". The Bono Act is thus perceived to add an instability to commerce and investment, areas which have a better legal theoretical basis than intellectual property, whose theory is of quite recent development and is often criticized as being a corporate chimera.

He suggested that it could be balanced by adding provisions from the Fairness in Music Licensing Act (H.R. 789). Lloyd Doggett (Texas) called the 'Fairness in Music Licensing Act' the 'Music Theft Act' and claimed that it was a mechanism to ""steal the intellectual property of thousands of small businesspeople who are song writers in this land."" The majority of subsequent debate was over Sensenbrenner's House Amendment 532 to the CTEA. This amendment was over details of allowing music from radio and television broadcasts in small businesses to be played without licensing fees. An amendment to Sensenbrenner's amendment was proposed by Bill McCollum. The key differences between Sensenbrenner's proposal and McCollum's amendment were 1) local arbitration versus court lawsuits in rate disagreements, 2) all retail businesses versus only restaurants and bars, 3) 3500 square feet of general public area versus of gross area, 4) which music licensing societies it applied to (all versus ASCAP and BMI), and 5) freedom from vicarious liability for landlords and others leasing space versus no such provision. After debate (and the first verse of American Pie) the McCollum Amendment was rejected in by 259 to 150 and the Sensenbrenner amendment was passed by 297 to 112.

In the other two matches, Oswaldo Gracie and Benedicto Peres defeated their opponents. The event was negatively received, however, not only due to a ruleset perceived as too favorable to the jiu-jitsu side, but also to accusations that Ferreira (a Greco-Roman wrestling teacher associated to Gracie) was not a capoeira master and therefore his side could not represent the art. Famous professional wrestler and sportsman Manoel Rufino dos Santos criticized further the Gracie family, so a fight was stipulated for August 22, 1931 between him and Carlos Gracie himself to settle it down. In response to the announcement, Carlos's teacher Donato Pires said through the press that Gracie's claims to be a direct apprentice to Mitsuyo Maeda were false and thus was equally unfit to represent jiu-jitsu.

After Johnston's resignation in 1978 Buxton was appointed caretaker manager of Huddersfield Town. He quickly got the job permanently and set about revitalising the Fourth Division club. He installed John Haselden, who was already at the club, as his Assistant Manager and he would also take on the Physio duties. Buxton's first season was the 1978-79 season where Huddersfield finished 9th in the Fourth Division. It was the season after which would prove to be the catalyst for the most successful period of Town's history in the past 10 years. He offloaded the deadwood and brought in players such as Brian Stanton, Mick Laverick and Steve Kindon. He would eventually go on to be one of the most successful managers in the club's recent history, winning promotion to the Third Division at the end of the 1979/80 season where the team scored 101 goals in the league. This team is still loved by the club to this day and have held reunions in 2000, 2010, 2016 and 2017 where the majority of the team and coaching staff still attend. Buxton then took Huddersfield up to the Second Division in 1983. The Terriers would remain in the second tier for five seasons, but Buxton was sacked on 23 December 1986, to be replaced by Steve Smith. Mick Buxton later returned to Town in March 1993 as coach under Ian Ross, and helped the Terriers on one of their best runs in recent history where they only lost once in last eighteen games to avoid relegation.

wikipedia,"The tournament has used several formats in its history, though seeding in all formats has been based strictly on conference record (with tiebreakers used as needed). When the tournament began in 1982, the conference had six members: Army, Fairfield, Fordham, Iona, Manhattan, and Saint Peter's. It used a standard single-elimination bracket that gave the 1 and 2 seeds a first-round bye into the semifinals, with the bottom four seeds playing in the first round at the highest seeded team's home court. The semifinals, and championship games were played at the Meadowlands Arena until 1990, when it was moved to the Knickerbocker Arena. The conference used this setup in the 1982, 1983, 1984, 1988, and 1989 tournaments.

With ten teams, a first round play-in format was used, with the bottom four teams playing a first round ""play-in"" game. The 1 seed would play in the quarterfinals against the highest remaining seed from the first round. This format was used until 2003, when the MAAC implemented a new format, and expanded to the bottom six teams playing in the first round, and giving the 1 seed a bye into the semifinals. The reasoning was to place a significant premium on in-season play. In 2007, they ended the change, citing the NIT awarding bids to conference regular season champions who fail to win their conference's tournament championship. Instead of the 1 seed playing the highest remaining seed from the first round, the MAAC used a basic bracket style. 7 vs. 10 and 8 vs. 9 in the first round, with the 8/9 winner facing the 1 seed, and the 7/10 winner facing the 2 seed.

Critics enjoyed the ""simple, yet enjoyable platform gameplay"", specifically citing Castlevania overtones and fresh, varied level design as strong points.

David Canter of The San Diego Union-Tribune felt the ""ability to control four diverse characters gives the game a nice touch of variety.""

There she bore Minos, Rhadamanthys and Sarpedon to Zeus, and he gave her a necklace made by Hephaestus that would figure in Theban saga as the Necklace of Harmonia. Sarpedon ruled Lycia, and was apparently granted a lifespan equal to three generations of men by Zeus. His death at Troy and the rain of blood it inspired Zeus to send is briefly described. Minos ruled Crete, succeeding his stepfather Asterion. Poseidon sent up from the sea a bull which had sex with Minos' wife Pasiphae, siring the Minotaur. To Minos she also bore Deucalion, Catreus, Androgeos and Eurygyes, though it is equally possible that these last two names referred to a single son.

From Argos Amphilochus and Alcmaeon, the sons of Amphiaraus, attempted to win Helen, but were perhaps never able to join in the contest because of their punishment for the matricide of Eriphyle. Ever shrewd, Odysseus did not give gifts but simply sent envoys to Castor and Polydeuces, because he knew that Menelaus would ultimately prevail. Thoas was not so wise and gave many sheep and cows in the hope of winning Helen. From Phylace, many gifts were given by Podarces and Protesilaus, who were cousins in the ""Catalogue"", not brothers as in the Catalogue of Ships.

These two passages are, in any event, isolated, and more discerning critics like Apollonius of Rhodes, Aristophanes of Byzantium and Crates of Mallus apparently found no reason to doubt the attribution to Hesiod, going so far as to cite the ""Catalogue"" in arguments concerning the content and authenticity of other Hesiodic poems.",128562,the first 10 lines,DT JJ CD NNS,the,first,10,lines,

It had a small size, a single longitudinal ridge on the snout, an elongated pineal foramen situated on a low boss located midway on the intertemporal bar, and a slender dentary symphysis. Some of these characteristics such as the shape of the pineal foramen and the presence of three longitudinal ridges were thought to be distinguishing characteristics of the genera as a whole, but are now only valid at specific level. Another new species was collected in Tanzania in 1963 and is under description. It is distinguished from all other specimens based on the lack of a pineal boss and the presence of a pair of tusks lateral to the tooth row.",146681,the other three species,DT JJ CD NNS,the,other,three,species,

wikipedia,"where E is the energy of the beam in Joules, τ is the duration of the pulse in seconds, A is the illuminating area in square meters, and f is the repetition rate of the pulsed beam in Hertz. Increasing the illumination area thus reduces the amount of generated nonlinear photons unless the energy is increased. Optical damage depends on the energy density, i.e. peak intensity per area I=E/(τA). Therefore, both the area and energy can be easily increased without the risk of optical damage if the peak intensity per area is kept low, and yet a gain in the amount of generated nonlinear photons can be obtained because of the quadratic dependence. For example, increasing both the area and energy 1000 fold, leaves the peak intensity unchanged but increases the generated nonlinear photons by 1000 fold. This 1000 extra photons are indeed generated over a larger area. In imaging this means that the extra 1000 photons are spread over the image, which at first might not seem an advantage over multiphoton scanning microscopy. The advantage however becomes evident when the size of the image and the scanning time are considered. The amount of nonlinear photons per image frame per second generated by a wide-field multiphoton microscope compared to a scanning multiphoton microscope is given by",172909,the extra 1000 photons,DT JJ CD NNS,the,extra,1000,photons,

The entire region was low-lying, and only a few million years (Ma) before ""Eremopezus"" inhabited these lands—and when sea levels were higher—submerged under the ocean. The climate was warmer than today, and the region probably was tropical with abundant rainfall during the monsoon season, as indicated by the paleosols formed from alluvial sediments and traces of buttress roots. Altogether, the habitat must have resembled the Niger Delta of our time.

Their success resulted in the widespread adoption of the system throughout Greater London over the next eight years using newer models of the Mackenzie Trench design now made completely of concrete for increased durability, save the doors, which were still made of teak. Constables complained that the concrete boxes were extremely cold and damp compared to their wooden predecessors, so provisions were made for more powerful heaters.

wikipedia,"Various antibodies directed at nerve cells have been reported in Guillain–Barré syndrome. In the axonal subtype, these antibodies have been shown to bind to gangliosides, a group of substances found in peripheral nerves. A ganglioside is a molecule consisting of ceramide bound to a small group of hexose-type sugars and containing various numbers of ""N""-acetylneuraminic acid groups. The key four gangliosides against which antibodies have been described are GM1, GD1a, GT1a, and GQ1b, with different anti-ganglioside antibodies being associated with particular features; for instance, GQ1b antibodies have been linked with Miller Fisher variant GBS and related forms including Bickerstaff encephalitis. The production of these antibodies after an infection is probably the result of molecular mimicry, where the immune system is reacting to microbial substances, but the resultant antibodies also react with substances occurring naturally in the body. After a ""Campylobacter"" infection, the body produces antibodies of the IgA class; only a small proportion of people also produce IgG antibodies against bacterial substance cell wall substances (e.g. lipooligosaccharides) that crossreact with human nerve cell gangliosides. It is not currently known how this process escapes central tolerance to gangliosides, which is meant to suppress the production of antibodies against the body's own substances. Not all antiganglioside antibodies cause disease, and it has recently been suggested that some antibodies bind to more than one type of epitope simultaneously (heterodimeric binding) and that this determines the response. Furthermore, the development of pathogenic antibodies may depend on the presence of other strains of bacteria in the bowel.",208000,The key four gangliosides,DT JJ CD NNS,The,key,four,gangliosides,

Foiled by the winter weather on this occasion, he was able a few months later to venture once more and he proceeded to take control of Kashmir from a half-brother, Salhana. Salhana had himself taken the throne after the briefest of reigns by Radda, one of the leaders of the conspiracy against Uccala, whose rule lasted a single day.

Bhikşācara mounted further attempts to regain the throne during the first two years and no sooner had he been killed than another challenger, Lothana, a brother of Salhana, succeeded in taking control of Lohara. That territory was subsequently recaptured but challenges continued from Lothana and two others who sought the throne, Mallājuna and Bhoja, the latter being a son of Salhana. Throughout this period there was also further troublesome behaviour generally from the dāmaras, as so often in the past, and also as in the past it was the fact that those chiefs also fought among themselves which enabled Jayasimha to survive. Peace came after 1145 and Jayasimha was able to employ his methods of kingship, which relied on diplomacy and Machiavellian plotting, for the greater good of his kingdom.

According to the 1949 Columbia catalog, issued September 1948, the first twelve-inch LP was Mendelssohn's Concerto in E Minor by Nathan Milstein on the violin with the New York Philharmonic, conducted by Bruno Walter (ML 4001). Three ten-inch series were released: 'popular', starting with the reissue of ""The Voice of Frank Sinatra"" (CL 6001); 'classical', numbering from Beethoven's 8th symphony (ML 2001), and 'juvenile', commencing with ""Nursery Songs"" by Gene Kelly (JL 8001). Also released at this time were a pair of 2-LP sets, Puccini's La Bohème (SL-1) and Humperdinck's Hansel & Gretel (SL-2). All 12-inch pressings were of 220 grams vinyl.

Moreover, other Arab groups, most notably the Palestinians, lost faith in the Pan-Arab movement and tried to branch out on their own. More recently, though, after the events of the Arab Spring of 2011, many scholars and journalists argue that Pan Arabism is coming back in different ways. Susan De Muth suggests that the Pan Arabism of the Arab Spring is different than it was thirty years ago. She suggests that the Pan Arabism of Gamel Nasser’s era was tied to the idea of keeping the Arab World free of foreign and western influence, while today’s Pan Arabism is mostly led by young people who are dedicated to reforming or making governments in Arab countries less oppressive or controlling. This new form of Pan Arabism has been strengthened by technology, like social media. According to De Muth, protesters from different countries have been able to strengthen their cause and even coordinate protests with movements in other Arab countries using social media. Other scholars are not as optimistic as De Muth; Marc Lynch suggests that the protests of the Arab Spring were long overdue, and that the political movements in the Arab Middle East have been slowly building strength for the last thirty years.",6259,the last thirty years,DT JJ CD NNS,the,last,thirty,years,

To weaken the Empire, her enemies (Britain and France), began to offer land to peoples in sections of the Empire for launching resistance to the Ottomans. This included offering Palestine to various Arab leaders (including the Husayn family of Saudi Arabia). At the same time, the British offered control of Palestine to a Jewish state that didn't yet exist. Although this action led to nothing, it still encouraged greater movement of Jews to Palestine as well as a fear of losing regional control for the Palestinians. In 1936, responding to the growing Jewish population, Palestinian Arabs led an armed revolt against the British and Jews in Palestine. The revolt, led by the mufti and head of the Arab Higher Committee Hajj Amin al-Husayni, was the first large-scale expression of a sense of Palestinian nationalism. Though it ended with the British and Jews putting down the revolt, the resulting White Paper of 1939 proved it had been an influential piece of resistance.

The most common use of a headgear as a symbol of freedom in the first two centuries after the Roman iconography was commonly used again was in the Netherlands, where the cap of liberty was used in the form of a hat of that time.

During the 1940s the factory of National Bohemian was the first in the US to adopt the six pack. In the 1970s, the Hoffberger family sold the brand name. During the next three decades, the brand of this beer was bought and sold by different companies. The copyright of the beer was purchased first by Stroh, then by G.

Another improvement replaced the flashpan with a smaller “priming pan” that held a smaller amount of black powder. It also contained an opening into the breach to ignite the main powder charge. A small piece of steel (called a “frizzen”) was mounted to the top of the priming pan. When the trigger was pulled the mechanism created a spark igniting the powder in barrel. When the powder and ball were loaded into the barrel, it was then tamped (pushed) down with the ramrod. The hammer was pulled back to the first click, called ""half-cocked"". To make the weapon ready to fire, the hammer was pulled back to the ""full-cocked"" position. When the trigger was pulled, a spring caused the hammer to fall igniting the charge.

Since the Chinese language has not had any sort of phonetic alphabet until only about a few hundred years ago (compared to the thousands of years the Chinese characters have been used), there has been a lot of confusion on naming places in Chinese. Since Chinese characters are a logographic writing system, meaning that the writing mainly shows the words' meaning rather than its pronunciation, it can be used to write down words in many different languages. On top of all this, the Chinese language is not one unified language, but an entire branch of the Sino-Tibetan language family. Many of the Chinese languages or dialects are mutually unintelligible, which means a speaker of one language or dialect cannot understand a speaker of another unless one of them already knew the other's language or dialect. For example, Mandarin and Cantonese are both dialects of Chinese, but they are so different from each other than their speakers cannot understand the other unless at least one speaker knew both. Therefore, knowing which spoken dialect to use when writing out the name in the Roman alphabet, which is a phonetic writing system and not a logographic one, can be challenging.

Renewed activity in the last 50,000 years has rebuilt the edifice in a series of violent eruptions, like when Mount Pelee erupted in 1902 and destroyed the town of St. Pierre on the island of Martinique. As successive pyroclastic flows travelled down the mountain's gentle slopes and were deposited, the volcano took on a broad, conical form. Part of the volcano's southwest flank built out onto thick glacial ice filling the Squamish River valley. Subsequent rapid melting of the ice at the close of the last ice age removed support from the western part of the cone. The volcano collapsed,producing much of the existing rugged topography of Mount Garibaldi and Atwell Peak. This catastrophic failure left a scarp on which is exposed the internal structure of the volcano and a debris fan with an estimated volume of 150,000,000 m at the foot of the mountain north of the town of Squamish. As valley glaciers retreated, two lava flows erupted Clinker Peak, immediately north of Mt. Garibaldi. The northernmost Rubble Creek flow was party confined by a wall of ice, resulting in a lava flow over 244 m (800 ft) thick. The steep, northern edge of the Rubble Creek flow party collapsed several times, most recently in 1855-1856; the village of Garibaldi was abandoned because of the danger of future collapses. The most recent period of activity occurred shortly after the disappearance of the glacial ice filling the valley, 10,700 to 9,300 radiocarbon years ago, and ended with the eruption the Ring Creek lava flow from Opal cone on Garibaldi's southeastern flank.",452042,"the last 50,000 years",DT JJ CD NNS,the,last,"50,000",years,

Sufferers are also often hesitant to seek treatment for chronic vulvar pain, especially since many women begin experiencing symptoms around the same time they become sexually active. Before being successfully diagnosed patients sometimes are told that the pain is ""in their head"". For the diagnosis doctor carefully takes a history and carefully examines the pelvis to duplicate the discomfort and to identify a site or source of the pelvic pain. The diagnosis of painful sexual act has to be differentiated from conditions known as ‘’’chronic vulvar pain’’’ and vaginismus. It is worth to be sure whether the painful sexual act is acquired or lifelong and whether it is generalized (complete) or situational. During the first two weeks, painful sexual act caused by penis insertion or movement of the penis in the vagina or by deep penetration is often due to disease or injury deep within the pelvis. Inquiry should determine whether the pain is superficial or deep - whether it occurs primarily at the vaginal outlet or vaginal barrel or upon deep thrusting against the cervix.

With shots keeping the enemy at bay, Hughes coolly turned his attention to reaching the remaining casualties and retrieving the dead.Clearing a path forward he discovered two further VOIEDs and, twice more, carried out manual neutralisation.

The Royal Engineers Search Team (REST) had detected a further four VOIEDs in the immediate area and stoically, like he has on over 80 other occasions in the last five months, he set about disposing of them too.Dealing with any form of IED is dangerous; to deal with seven VOIEDs linked in a single circuit, in a mass casualty scenario, using manual neutralisation techniques once, never mind three times, is the single most outstanding act of explosive ordnance disposal ever recorded in Afghanistan.That he did it without the security of specialist protective clothing serves even more to demonstrate his outstanding gallantry.

The C–C bond lengths are greater than a double bond (135 pm) but shorter than a single bond (147 pm). This intermediate distance is consistent with electron delocalization: the electrons for C–C bonding are distributed equally between each of the six carbon atoms. The molecule is planar. One representation is that the structure exists as a superposition of so-called resonance structures, rather than either form individually. (In other words, the molecule's double bonds switch quickly between pairs of carbon atoms.) The delocalization of electrons is one explanation for the thermodynamic stability of benzene and related aromatic compounds. It is likely that this stability contributes to the peculiar molecular and chemical properties known as aromaticity.

But in 1936 he was passed over in both - first in Philadelphia, where Eugene Ormandy succeeded Stokowski at the Philadelphia Orchestra, and then in New York, where Toscanini's departure left a vacancy at the New York Philharmonic but John Barbirolli and Artur Rodzinski were engaged in preference to Klemperer. The New York decision was particularly galling, as Klemperer had been engaged to conduct the first fourteen weeks of the New York Philharmonic's 1935-6 season. Klemperer's bitterness at this decision was voiced in a letter he wrote to Arthur Judson, who ran the orchestra: ""that the society did not re-engage me is the strongest offense, the sharpest insult to me as artist, which I can imagine. You see, I am no youngster. I have a name and a good name. One could not use me in a most difficult season and then expel me. This non-reengagement will have very bad results not only for me in New York but in the whole world...

His conversation with the waiter, an hour ago, chanced to be on the subject of this murder of the Zemarins, and the latter had agreed with him about it. He thought of the waiter again, and decided that he was no fool, but a steady, intelligent man: though, said he to himself, “God knows what he may really be; in a country with which one is unfamiliar it is difficult to understand the people one meets.” He was beginning to have a passionate faith in the Russian soul, however, and what discoveries he had made in the last six months, what unexpected discoveries!

In the first place, Mr. Keller, you have greatly overestimated my fortune in your article. I am far from being a millionaire. I have barely a tenth of what you suppose. Secondly, my treatment in Switzerland was very far from costing tens of thousands of roubles. Schneider received six hundred roubles a year, and he was only paid for the first three years. As to the pretty governesses whom Pavlicheff is supposed to have brought from Paris, they only exist in Mr. Keller’s imagination; it is another calumny. According to my calculations, the sum spent on me was very considerably under ten thousand roubles, but I decided on that sum, and you must admit that in paying a debt I could not offer Mr. Burdovsky more, however kindly disposed I might be towards him; delicacy forbids it; I should seem to be offering him charity instead of rightful payment. I don’t know how you cannot see that, gentlemen! Besides, I had no intention of leaving the matter there. I meant to intervene amicably later on and help to improve poor Mr. Burdovsky’s position. It is clear that he has been deceived, or he would never have agreed to anything so vile as the scandalous revelations about his mother in Mr. Keller’s article.
