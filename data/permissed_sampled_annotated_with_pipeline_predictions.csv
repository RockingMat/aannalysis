oh seven takes three hundred apt so every month she has an increasing three hundred dollar balance their checkbook so once a year when she has to pay those in your bills she writes the bills but she didn't have to subtract anything from ballots are free kit and see the system works quite well and it makes her feel better about doing it et cetera but if you look at her checkbook you see three hundred circle with red and the next month it'll say six hundred circled with red ink the nine hundred circled with reading so i told her one time i said perjure nursing home i'll just bring in your

you back when we go back to the handout dimension is defined as a group of symptoms referring to a global impairment of mental functioning the impairment interferes with the client's ability to perform daily activities dementia is caused by a variety of diseases and it is never ever part of the normal aging process dementia is difficult to distinguish from delirium or depression based solely on behavior dementia results from organic disease and it's usually irreversible in progressive you are shut that door back there the big picture of dementia is that we have brain cells neurons with dementia get damaged in some manner so there's actual physical damage to the neurones those neurons are responsible for storing transmitting in utilizing information when they get damaged they don't work anymore so with alston immersed in the chip they get tangle they get twisted they develop plaque or deposits on and they're not unlike our troops chronic plaque in the group in the blood vessels and when that happens they stop being functional once that starts it's generally irreversible and it's progressing so the personable all timidly get weaker and weaker in topic with other types of dementia is there's different types of physical decay the neurons but they all involve physical decay to neurons prevalence rates of dementia are not nearly as high as you would think that they are i've someone from age sixty five to seventy four the odds of than having a sip as severe dementia is one percent from age seventy five to eighty four that jumps to seven percent and eighty-five and over it goes to twenty five percent that's from a new jersey alzheimer's disease study someone challenge that the other day in seminar and we were to be a sermon looked it up bsn prevalence rates are very similar to things so one-in-four is really a significant number at the age of eighty five but it's not the number that you would think that was seems like to me they taught us in graduate school that it eight to eighty eighty percent of people were demented age nineteen ninety percent of people were demented and if you live long enough everybody got to meet well it's just double row by the numbers you know it's just not true dimension is a reasonably rare disease i mean one and four at the age of eighty five but that still means three and four don't of all the types of dimensions probably sixty percent of these are in fact alzheimer's dementia but the only way to no one type of dementia from the other is on brain biopsy and most people don't like to have that done so we generally find out on autopsy what type of dementia that it was so that sixty percent turnout to be alzheimer's twenty percent multi infarct twenty percent something else the multi infarct we can distinguish by the way because we do ct scan it see if we see multiple layers of infor thomas each year the mri_ is some forty are has sort of recognize that it would now simplified dementia coach

sky news has arab perfect piece of propaganda but by the way partly owned by newscorp reports rupert murdoch uh... they now claim that iran has an operational relationship without it when i seen this movie before remember when they sent all with the racked our case operation waitress inflate lens one so that you and your money and that sort of about ten times their products and got at the same time we've got a date savings that will be here with a rod but it's even less sensible because at least saddam hussein was suny are tennessee errata al-qaeda hate each other around as she a and alligators suny they're sworn enemies the one-time iran helped us over the last ten years was when we went into afghanistan 'cause they want to also wiped out al-qaeda which was one of their top threats in the region so this argument in this political islam sense through through nineteen but total or scrap propaganda so here we go all these things pringle dinard that this would be heard attacks would be maybe perhaps in europe and of course branson or was not at all and that you didn't mention that i was rich sent dorm but there is a good had uh... that uh... iran has given some upon me and safe haven for al qaeda that it has operational capacity to help al qaeda and that iran is doing is apparently and it actually being revenge for killing a sob in line a running haiti does sound in law and then the thing about this piece of evidence they have they say yeltsin also read is anarchy the operative one of the top operatives and that iran has i don't know if that's true but that could be true you know why iran would want to capture one of the top al-qaeda operatives they put in jail because they're getting started no no they twist this guy who says who say that iran claims he said the protective custody now take a dot lights and guide they're opposed to a guy there weren't probably he's gonna do terrorism inside their own country if they have no i don't trust things guys wanted the sky news that i love this the next one is a source a source said that iran is the main route through which funding for the organization is made valley froggy really that arising is the main source of funding for al-qaeda if that's true it would turn the whole thing outside and as well as the reporting historically have come from saturday the and then obviously some from pakistan uh... who are both soon he is now the she are pointing out in that but did you notice that at source said not an intelligence source i mean i know synonymous sources you get you some every once in awhile sometimes are from the intelligence medium clarify who they are here in this joke about article they like a source of it academic my uncle and could have been in the oconee could've been a guy who does truly was a dike around could've been a exxon mobil execu outlet as source at it and then even clarified say the sources have no specific you know this on what they are cute organs now what it might be watched because that source is full of crap and there is no such attack sought to say that outdated doesn't wanna tak western targets of course they do are they working codes with uh... a rotten you have no evidence of that this ipl you know it could be europe it could be the olympic games i could be anything he made in santa claus and a source said the stressing this is only an assessment not based on any specific intelligence i love how they admit that in paragraph eighteen or twenty eight or whatever this is right all in the middle of the art of they have either awareness was being built and then they could claim that there's a secret memo uh... says that intensive cooperation over recent months between iran al-qaeda with a view to conducting a joint attack against western tour what's the source for that secret memos and of course you see if throughout the article all these assumptions they say for example without any into one whether it's sure untrue like meaning like is there evidence of this or not basic israel which would face in eggs central threat from a nuclear ron has been debating the merits and ease of an attack on iraq now which part of my word i don't know and that's just assumes like what obviously israel phase-in existential threat from iran 'cause if they were to have a nuclear program they were obviously work without pay then obviously they were target iraq israel and obviously they would like israel off the map these things are all obvious this is an assumption in the middle of the sky news or uh... hands all this is of course lead up to since there are these fantasies of a source of arms with no intelligence tobacco whatsoever and just a bunch of stuff assumptions we made we ship obviously attacked we should watch all wall began ceron based on the status is an assumption this is how our media and our politicians or try to drive us to another disastrous war in the middle east but have you thought iraq was bad
