1539,It's a special three-weeks Honor program.
1555,I get a plus 1 oxidation state here.
1588,"So for the entire hydroxide molecule, you have a minus 1 sum."

2761,So we know that this hydrogen is going to have a plus 1 oxidation state.
2789,So it's going to have a minus 2 oxidation state.
2803,So it's going to have a minus 2 oxidation state.

2662,"Okay, so the following theorem is going to show that in fact CBC mode encryption with a random IV is in fact semantically secure under a chosen plaintext attack, and so let's take that more precisely, basically if we start with a PRP, in other words, our block cipher E, that is defined over a space X, then we are gonna to end up with a encryption algorithm Ecbc that takes messages of length L and outputs ciphertexts of length L+1."
