2698,"Mr. Dashwoods's editorial gravity relaxed into a smile, for Jo had forgotten her 'friend', and spoken as only an author could."
2962,"She was living in bad society, and imaginary though it was, its influence affected her, for she was feeding heart and fancy on dangerous and unsubstantial food, and was fast brushing the innocent bloom from her nature by a premature acquaintance with the darker side of life, which comes soon enough to all of us."

2160,"And in fact, that's kind of what I plan to do is instrument the test case itself to generate a series of silly, stupid linear statements and generate a new test case out of that and then throw away the original because as clever and as easy to modify as it is, it's not actually helpful when you're trying to track down a particular bug."

1346,"Now, however preposterous it may at first seem to talk of any creature’s skin as being of that sort of consistence and thickness, yet in point of fact these are no arguments against such a presumption; because you cannot raise any other dense enveloping layer from the whale’s body but that same blubber; and the outermost enveloping layer of any animal, if reasonably dense, what can that be but the skin?"
1638,"Desecrated as the body is, a vengeful ghost survives and hovers over it to scare."
760,"However curious it may seem for an oil-ship to be borrowing oil on the whale-ground, and however much it may invertedly contradict the old proverb about carrying coals to Newcastle, yet sometimes such a thing really happens; and in the present case Captain Derick De Deer did indubitably conduct a lamp-feeder as Flask did declare."
2154,"Anomalous as it may seem, this is precisely the case with the whale, who systematically lives, by intervals, his full hour and more (when at the bottom) without drawing a single breath, or so much as in any way inhaling a particle of air; for, remember, he has no gills."
3002,"This was still more strangely evinced by those of their number, who, completely paralysed as it were, helplessly floated like water-logged dismantled ships on the sea."
3465,"Riotous and disordered as the universal commotion now was, it soon resolved itself into what seemed a systematic movement; for having clumped together at last in one dense body, they then renewed their onward flight with augmented fleetness."

1643,"He himself slept peacefully and snored aloud, yet my heart was sore for him, wicked as he was, to think on the dark perils that environed and the shameful gibbet that awaited him."

1148,"There might have been twenty people there , young and old , but they all played , and so did Scrooge ; for , wholly forgetting , in the interest he had in what was going on , that his voice made no sound in their ears , he sometimes came out with his guess quite loud , and very often guessed right , too , for the sharpest needle , best Whitechapel , warranted not to cut in the eye , was not sharper than Scrooge ; blunt as he took it in his head to be ."
409,"When his attack was over, and the prince reflected on his symptoms, he used to say to himself: “These moments, short as they are, when I feel such extreme consciousness of myself, and consequently more of life than at other times, are due only to the disease to the sudden rupture of normal conditions."
434,"Vague though this sounds, it was perfectly comprehensible to Muishkin, though he knew that it was but a feeble expression of his sensations."

612,"But he could not bear to see her crouching down upon the little seat where he had often looked on her , with love and pride , so innocent and gay ; and , when she rose and left him , sobbing as she went , he felt it a relief to have the vacant place beside him rather than her so long-cherished presence ."

2412,unexpected as it was unusual.
2602,"However small Elinor's general dependence on Lucy's veracity might be, it was impossible for her on serious reflection to suspect it in the present case, where no temptation could be answerable to the folly of inventing a falsehood of such a description."

3781,"I had depended on her fortitude too far, and the blow was a severe one but had her marriage been happy, so young as I then was, a few months must have reconciled me to it, or at least I should not have now to lament it."
27,"Bad indeed must the nature of Marianne's affliction be, when her mother could talk of fortitude!"
179,"The calm and polite unconcern of Lady Middleton on the occasion was a happy relief to Elinor's spirits, oppressed as they often were by the clamorous kindness of the others."
2990,"She then left the room; and Elinor dared not follow her to say more, for bound as she was by her promise of secrecy to Lucy, she could give no information that would convince Marianne; and painful as the consequences of her still continuing in an error might be, she was obliged to submit to it."
3246,"Happy had it been for her, if her regard for Edward had depended less on his own merit, than on the merit of his nearest relations!"
62,"But unwelcome as such a task must be, it was necessary to be done, and Elinor therefore hastened to perform it."
75,"Edward seemed a second Willoughby; and acknowledging as Elinor did, that she HAD loved him most sincerely, could she feel less than herself!"
1875,"Affrighted though she was , Wendy swelled with pride ."
1998,"difficult though it was, he took his courage in both hands, and said:"
2006,"Will you be so good as to tell him that the living of Delaford, now just vacant, as I am informed by this day's post, is his, if he think it worth his acceptance but THAT, perhaps, so unfortunately circumstanced as he is now, it may be nonsense to appear to doubt; I only wish it were more  valuable."
2615,"Elinor had just been congratulating herself, in the midst of her perplexity, that however difficult it might be to express herself properly by letter, it was at least preferable to giving the information by word of mouth, when her visitor entered, to force her upon this greatest exertion of all."
2800,"They were his dogs snapping at him , but , tragic figure though he had become , he scarcely heeded them ."
