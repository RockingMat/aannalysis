0,It may not look like much now but this is actually going to turn into one of the three student lounges which is a really big step up from our old campus.
1,Right beside me is going to be the future home of the Nittany Lion.
3,Bye!
4,In this video I'll be demonstrating the grade by submission method of grading in Etudes.
5,This is preferred over the grade by question method for an assessment that has more than one question on it that requires manual grading.
6,This is because with this method you remain on a single submission until you finish grading all questions before you move on to the next submission
7,"So after you log in, click on Assignments, Tests &amp;amp; Surveys"
8,"When you're at the main AT&amp;amp;S page, click on the red pen icon next to the assessment you want to grade"
9,Remember that the red pen icon means there are ungraded submissions for that assessment.
10,This takes you to the main grading page for the assessment.
11,On this page you'll see a listing of all your students and the details about their attempts for the assessment
12,"So you see I have three students listed here and it shows when they've started, when they finished, their auto score, because this is manually graded it's 0, their final score and then there are columns for evaluated and released"
13,Notice that the students who have finished have clickable links with the red pen icon next to them.
14,So we're going to click on one of these students - click on their name
15,This will take you to the page of that student's submission
17,"And if they can be fooled, every single person I ever talk to has to realize they have put their ego on hold and say, you know what, I might be able to be fooled, too."
19,We had the fake division that did restoration work.
20,The real division had hundreds and hundreds of employees.
21,"The fake division had one employee, me."
22,"I supposedly found all the jobs, bid the jobs, hired all the outside work crews, and handled all of the jobs."
23,That very thing should have been probably the single biggest red flag that ever could have existed.
24,"That is the thing that I think, above all else-- forget the even 50% profit margins-- someone would say, how is some one person able to handle this entire workload?"
25,"And what I ended up finding out was that, unfortunately-- well, let me put it this way."
26,And hope I don't get too far astream for you.
27,"Accounting work, especially accounting work-- accountants are the most important part of the triumvirate."
28,Because you can get another banker.
29,A bank loan can fall apart and you can maybe replace that in a matter of days or hours.
30,"And I'm not trying to be besmirching anyone, but"
31,lawyers are pretty easy to find.
32,"If one law firm doesn't want to work with you, some other"
33,law firm will.
36,"And if you fire your auditor, that sends shock waves through all of corporate America."
37,"They go, oh, my god, they fired an auditor."
39,"So you kind of have to, a little bit, coddle the accountants."
40,"But what I tried to do with all of those people in the triumvirate, is basically convince them to do all the"
41,lifting for me.
42,"Most people think that a fraudster like myself try to outsmart you, or try to manipulate you to get you do what you don't want to do."
43,We do the opposite.
44,We always act dumber than we really are.
45,I'm always remembering Senator Sam Ervin during the famous
49,Guy's sharp as a nail.
51,"I'd say to my accountant, I don't understand what it is you're doing."
52,"So that when I give you my paperwork, if it's stinks, or doesn't look right, or isn't totally there, you forgive me."
53,"Because you go, Mark doesn't understand what's going on here."
54,"We set the expectation level low, rather than trying to blow you away with how clever and how sharp we are."
60,"No fraudster would ever make it, ever, trying to force you to sign something you don't want sign."
61,Human nature won't let you do it.
64,What they have to be worried about is the exact opposite.
65,"When they did it all themselves, and they wake up one day going, how did I how to talk myself into doing that?"
66,This is the biggest irony.
67,"Of that entire division, no one ever saw, or asked to see, one original source document."
68,They never saw one invoice that had been signed.
70,"I would then take the cashier's check, I would Xerox it, because they were always made out to me."
71,The check was made out to me.
72,And I'd go cash it.
73,"But I'd first Xerox it, then I would white out my name."
74,"Then I'd type in the name of some bogus vendor, and give that Xerox copy back to the auditors."
76,"They would simply see the check I used to buy it, and my"
77,"Xerox copy, and they accepted that."
78,"I can tell you, because see, since there never were any original documents, there only were Xerox's, that they didn't exist."
79,"But isn't it ironic, not one person in that entire chain ever asked to see an original source document."
80,In the entire restoration division.
81,"What's funny about it is the first time Barry Minkow ever made up a fake job, he didn't have an invoice to write on."
82,So he took one of our standard invoices that I would give to
83,Mrs.
84,Housewife to clean her living room and dining room and hall carpets for $39.95.
85,"He used that same invoice to draw up about a $50,000 insurance restoration bill."
86,And then that escalated to a couple hundred thousand dollars.
87,"And pretty soon, he was drawing up fake work orders in the millions of dollars."
90,"We would bid a $10 million construction job, and the entire bid and specifications would fit on the front side of one page."
91,"Well, anyone who's ever done construction would tell you that a bid and acceptance for a $10 million job would look"
93,"And yet, we just did that on the front side of one page."
94,"And no one ever said, is this the industry standard?"
95,"One day, one of the civil attorneys in the civil case, one of the plaintiff's attorneys came to me and said,"
96,"Mark, where there ever any questions you were afraid of?"
103,"No one ever said, where's your license number?"
105,"No one ever said, how do you manage to oversee all those jobs and go to the bank every day?"
107,You could tell by the dates of the checks that I wrote that I had to be at the bank that day.
108,"And yet, no one ever asked."
109,"A lot of that is because the way compartmentalization works, especially at big firms, is such that, truly, the left hand does not know what the right hand is doing."
111,Another one's looking at your inventory.
113,They don't talk to each other.
114,They don't look at each other.
115,They have no idea.
116,And they're in a hurry.
118,"I can't stress enough-- we didn't have any, because they were all fake."
119,What I did was I invented six vendors.
120,"One of them was a company that I owned, called Marvel"
121,Management.
122,And the others were post office boxes.
123,"I just went out and rented post office boxes, made up companies, made up invoices at the print shop."
124,"And filled out the invoices and handed them to the auditors saying, I'm doing millions of dollars worth of work, with say, for example, this company I invented called"
126,Then the auditors would mail verifications to the post office boxes that I had rented.
127,"I would verify that they do all this business with me, and"
128,I would send them back.
129,"Virtually no due diligence was ever done on our vendors, because had they looked at our number one vendor, they would have found, by simply running a Dun and Bradstreet, or simply looking at the Secretary of State, looking at our DBA, they would have discovered that that corporation was mine."
132,"Just an address, and the address said Suite 104, 106, instead of post office box, because most of the places I rented boxes from would allow you to do that."
134,"And to the best of my knowledge, no attempt was ever make to go see one of the vendors."
137,"San Fernando Valley, within blocks of the auditor's office box."
138,Blocks.
140,"I've talked to quite a few companies that have said,"
141,"Mark, we believe that our internal ethics group is good enough."
142,"And you know what, they might be right."
144,"And that's why I've often said, even if you think you can handle it all in house all the time, bring in an outsider who's got a fresh pair of eyes."
145,There's no nepotism.
147,He's not worried about losing his job.
149,He's going to get paid and then he's going to go away.
150,"Those things are really necessary because one, they give comfort to the investors, to the shareholders."
152,"And so we can pass new laws, we can have the"
153,"Sarbanes-Oxley, we can change the FASB recommendations, we can change a whole lot of things."
154,"But until companies say, we have to be Caesar's wife."
155,We have to be above reproach.
157,"And I think that that is, without a doubt, the biggest message."
158,The other messages is this.
159,"Yes, there's a possibility that a corporate executive that does bad decisions might go to jail."
160,But that's not the real reason to fear.
161,We don't see our jails bursting with white collar guys.
162,And it's not even the money you can lose by running your business or spending a little bit more of your productivity on ethics and compliance.
163,The problem is that we've evolved to a point where your company can lose tens of billions of dollars in worth simply because of the way you handled something.
164,We've seen WorldCom lose over $100 billion in market cap.
165,Enron lose $90 billion.
166,Citigroup lose $50 billion.
167,These are serious numbers.
168,Those aren't fines or penalties.
169,That's what just dissolved because of the way the company handled certain issues.
170,"And invariably in those issues, due diligence was involved."
171,"So ethics were involved in the planning of it, or lack of ethics were involved in the planning of it."
173,And a total lack of follow through.
175,As much as I want it.
177,I will be the whistleblower.
178,We cannot tolerate this and have it here.
180,"And if there is a lesson to be learned by the recent scandals, and by the analysis that I bring to fraud prevention and fraud detection, it is that."
181,"Well, I think the most important thing any individual can do is there are things they can do to indemnify themselves, to protect themselves."
182,"And I should tell you, nobody else is going to do this for you."
183,Most people that are in federal prison today are in prison because a co-defendant told on them.
185,"And the way the system works, somebody goes, Mark, if you can give me a bigger name than you, you go to jail for less."
186,"So how does a low person who doesn't really have anyone to give away, and might get blamed, how do they protect themselves?"
187,And so what I tell every single accountant I meet to do is to do this thing that I developed about 10 years ago.
188,It's not brain surgery.
189,It's called the two minute drill.
192,You're not really sure whether you're being told the truth.
197,See if they pay the proper sales tax.
199,"If anybody had driven by one of the Z Best vendors, they'd have see that it wasn't a vendor at all, that it was just a postal rental place."
200,"Every day, do two minutes of extra due diligence."
201,And then make a journal entry of it.
202,Keep a diary.
204,"Because what you'll have is at the end of a year, you'll have a list of 250 things you did you weren't required to do."
208,"It used to be, no, you're innocent until proven guilty."
209,[ERRT]
210,"No, just ask Martha Stewart."
211,That's not true anymore.
212,"And especially in the court of public opinion, which, as I just mentioned, sometimes is a lot more important than what goes on in any courtroom."
216,"Because they'll go, I've seen what kind of person this guy is."
217,"This is a guy who goes the extra mile, who really looks for this."
219,"I imagine many of you are already clear on your reasons for taking this course, but let me begin by justifying the course's existence."
221,"So, what is an algorithm?"
222,"Well, we're not going to be needing a precise definition in this course, but essentially, an algorithm is a well-defined set of rules."
223,A recipe in effect for solving some kind of computational problem.
225,"Maybe you're given a road network with an origin and a destination, and you want to compute the shortest path from point a to point b."
226,Maybe you're given a bunch of tasks with deadlines and you want to know weather or not it's feasible to accomplish all of those tasks by their respective deadlines.
228,"Well, first of all, understanding the field of algorithms, and also the related field of data structures, is crucial for doing serious work in pretty much any other branch of Computer"
229,Science.
230,"That's the precise reason why here at Stanford University, this is the course that's required for all of the degrees that the Computer Science"
231,"Department grants, be it a Bachelors, a Masters, or a PhD degree, we insist that you have mastery of the field of algorithms."
232,"So, what are some examples of uses in the rest of Computer Science?"
233,"Well, if you're doing routing and communication network, that piggybacks on classical shortest path algorithms."
234,"the effectiveness of public key cryptography really rests on that, of number theoretic algorithms."
236,"Database indices rely on balance search tree data structures, as covered in this course."
237,and computational biology uses dynamic programming algorithms to measure similarity among genomes.
238,And the list goes on and on.
239,A second reason to study a lgorithms is that they play a key role in modern technological innovation.
240,"Obviously, I could give any number of examples here."
242,which is that search engines use a tapestry of algorithms to efficiently compute the relevance of various web pages.
243,The most famous search algorithm which you may have heard of is the page rank algorithm in use by Google.
244,"Indeed, in a December 2010 report to the United States Whitehouse, the President's Counsel of Advisers on Science and Technology argued that in many areas, performance gains due to improvements in algorithms, have vastly exceeded even the dramatic performance gains due to increased processor speed, as you'd be familiar with in the form of Moore's Law."
245,"Third, although this is getting significantly outside the scope of this course, algorithms are increasingly being used to provide a novel lens on processes outside of Computer Science and Technology."
246,"For example, the set of quantum computation has provided a new and computational viewpoint on quantum mechanics, price fluctuations in economic markets can be fruitfully viewed as an algorithmic process, and even evolution can be usefully thought of as, as a surprisingly search algorithm."
247,"The last two reasons I'm going to give you might sound a little flipping but, you know, I, I think there is more than a grain of truth to both of them."
248,"Now, I don't know about you but back when I was a student my favorite classes were always challenging classes but after"
249,"I struggled through them, I somehow felt I had a few more IQ points than when I started."
250,"So, I hope this course provides a similar experience for many of you that one the one hand it's a bit of a struggle."
252,"Finally, I hope that by the end of the course, a constant fraction of you will agree with me that designing and analyzing algorithms is simply fun."
253,"It's an endeavor that requires a rare blend of creativity and precision and it can cer tainly be frustrating at times, but even more than that, it is addictive."
255,"And also, let's remember that we've all been learning and using algorithms since we were little kids."
256,"So, once upon a time, in roughly third grade or so, you learned how to multiply two numbers."
257,"Now, you probably weren't thinking in these terms at the time, but multiplying two numbers is certainly a well-defined computational problem and that procedure you learned back in third grade or so, is indeed an algorithm."
259,little bit more precise.
261,"And to make things interesting, why don't you think about n as being really quite large, say in the thousands?"
262,Maybe we're implementing an algorithm that's going to be used in a cryptography application where you need to keep track of really quite large numbers.
263,"So, if we call the two input numbers x and y, the problem is simply to compute their product, xy."
264,times y.
265,"So, a quick digression."
266,I'll certainly be the first to admit that my handwriting is not the greatest.
267,"I got a C in penmanship back in elementary school, and I think the teacher was being a little generous but, you know, it's got an acquired taste, but trust me, you will get used to it."
269,"Now, when we talk about procedures for multiplying two numbers, we're going to be interested in counting how many steps are required, in order to execute the multiplication."
270,"So, how do we count a step?"
271,"We'll talk more about this more later, but for multiplying two numbers, let's just call a step, the addition or multiplication of two single digit numbers."
272,"So, let's review the integer multiplication algorithm that we learned back in grade school, just by working through a concrete example."
273,"Specifically, let's think of n equals four."
274,"So, let's look at two four-digit numbers"
275,"let's say, five, six, seven, eight, and one, two, three, four ."
276,"Now, as you'll recall, the procedure we learned way back when was just to take each digit of the bottom number and multiply it by each of the top numbers."
278,"So, for example, you start with the four."
279,"You multiply it by eight, so you get 32."
280,Carry the three.
281,"four times seven is 28, add the three, you get one, carry the three, and so on."
284,"Then, you do a shift, so you effectively put a zero in this final digit, and you repeat that procedure using the next digit, the three."
285,"So again, three times eight is four, carry the two, and so on."
286,And you compute the final two partial products using the two and the one.
287,"And having computed all of the partial products, you just add them up to get the final product."
289,"And more generally, how many does it require to multiply two n digit numbers as a function of n."
292,"So, just in ballpark terms, it seems that multiplying two n digit numbers required essentially a quadratic number of operations, a small number of operations to fill in each entry in this grid."
294,"In a little more detail, we could look at each of the partial products separately."
295,"So, to compute, say, this first partial product, what do we do?"
298,"But, in the end, we did somewhere between, say, n and the 2n, primitive operations to compute this first partial product."
300,"So, that's roughly n operations for each of the n partial products ."
302,It could be all of the partial products.
304,But that takes just an extra number of constant times n primitive operations to do all of those additions.
305,"So summarizing, overall, the number of primitive operations required to multiply to n digit numbers using this procedure grows quadratically with the length N. So, for example, if you double the length of two numbers, you expect to do roughly four times as many primitive operations if you use this iterative algorithm for multiplying two numbers."
306,"Now, depending on what type of third grader you were, you might well have accepted this procedure as being the unique or at least the optimal way of multiplying two n digit numbers together."
309,"It's from a quite early textbook in the field The Design and Analysis of Computer Algorithms by Aho,"
310,"Hopcroft, and Ullman, and after highlighting a number of algorithmic design techniques, they conclude by saying, perhaps the most important principle for the good algorithm designer is to refuse to be content."""
311,"So, that's a beautifully accurate quote."
312,"I might rephrase it more succinctly by just saying, if you're, want to be a good algorithm designer, you should adopt the following mantra."
313,"You should always be asking, can we do better?"
314,"This is particularly appropriate question to ask when you're faced with some kind of naive or obvious algorithm for solving a problem, like the third grade algorithm for energy multiplication."
317,"There'll be an obvious solution but with some extra algorithmic ingenuity by detecting subtle structure in the problem, we'll be able to do signifigantly, qualitatively better than the naive or the obvious solution to the problem."
318,"So, let's apply this cocky attitude to the problem of multiplying two in tegers."
319,"Let's just take, suppose as a working hypothesis that there is some procedure which is better than what we learned back in elementary school."
322,But they're also recursive programs.
323,"These are programs that call themselves, typically, on an input of a similar form, but with smaller size."
324,"So, as a working hypothesis,"
325,let's imagine that there's some interesting recursive approach to multiplying two integers.
327,"Well, it must somehow fundamentally involve calling itself on smaller problems."
329,"So, what kind of decomposition on numbers could be used to enable this kind of recursive approach?"
332,"And the second half of the digits, regard that as a number in its own right."
333,"So, perhaps this decomposition will have some use, in enabling a recursive attack on how to multiply two images."
334,"So, we're going to investigate that in more detail on this next slide."
335,"Given x and y, each with n over two digits, we're going to represent x as terms of its first half of the digits a and its second half of the digit to b."
337,"And in this expansion, a and b, c and d are all n over two digit numbers."
339,"This will extend to the case where n is odd in the natural way, where you break it into n over two rounded up and n over two rounded down."
340,"So, in our previous example, where x was 5,678 and y was 1,234, we would have a being equal to 56 ."
341,The first two digits of the four in x.
342,And then b would be the other two digits.
344,They have decomposition of y.
345,"So now, in a purely mechanical way, we can expand the product of x times y in terms of this representation."
346,"In terms of these smaller numbers, a, b, c, and d."
349,"So, that's combining two terms from the expansion, plus bd."
351,"Now, what I want you to think about and make sure you understand is that, this expansion that I've circled and called star, immediately suggests a recursive algorithm for multiplying two integers."
353,"But certainly, it's a legitimate recursive approach to multiplying two integers."
354,"Specifically, the relevant product in star namely ac, ad, bc, and bd all involve smaller numbers than what we stared with."
356,Those all original inputs at n digits so we can legitimately solve those recursively.
357,We can invoke our same algorithm to compute those in a recursive way.
358,"Now, once we've invoked our multiplication algorithm recursively four times to compute these four relevant products, now we can just compute the expression in star in the obvious way."
359,We take ad and bc.
360,"We add them together, using the just, standard first grade iterative addition algorithm."
361,"Then, we add both ac and the result of that addition by a bunch of zeros, n over two zeros or n zeros as appropriate."
362,"Now, we have these three constituent terms and we just add them up again using the grade school algorithms to compute the overall expression."
363,"So, to keep this intro lecture brisk, I haven't discussed the base case of this recursive al gorithm."
364,"As, hopefully, you all know, recursive algorithms do need base cases."
365,"At some point, the recursion has got to stop."
366,"Otherwise, your algorithm is never going to terminate."
368,"If the numbers have two or more digits, you would recurse in the way we have described here."
369,"If there's one digit, you just compute them and you're done."
370,"So, who knows whether this recursive algorithm is a good idea or not, it's totally not obvious, you should not even necessarily have any intuition about how this compares to the iterative algorithm you learned back in elementary school."
372,"So, to explain this algorithm, let me write once again our expansion in terms of the n over two digit numbers."
374,"Now, the previous approach was in recognition of the four products that we see in this expression."
375,We made four recursive calls.
376,"So, here's the trick, and this is really what Gauss figured out over 200 years ago which is that it seems there are four products."
377,"But fundamentally, in this expression, there's really only three quantities that we care about."
378,"There's the ac, the coefficient of this first term."
381,We really don't care about them individually.
382,"So, that motivates the question, perhaps we can somehow uncover these three d ifferent quantities using only three recursive calls rather than four."
385,We go ahead and compute ac and bd recursively.
386,"The third step is the, is the clever one where we recursively compute the product of quantity a plus b with c plus d."
387,"Now, expanding what are we going to get when we recursively compute this product, we're going to get ac plus bd plus ad plus bc."
388,"And here is Gauss's trick for observation which is that the result of the third recursive call minus each of the first two, what happens?"
389,"Well, the ac is going to cancel the ac, the bd is going to cancel the bd and we will be left with ad + bc, which is exactly that middle coefficience that we cared about."
390,"So, we can indeed compute the sum of ad and bc without separately computing each of them, and that's exactly what we wanted."
391,"So, what is this bias?"
393,Only three recursive calls rather than four.
394,"And as before, there's a little bit of work to do beyond the recursive calls but not much."
395,You just have to do some padding by zeroes and adding up the results.
396,"So, there is two points I want you to appreciate about all these energy multiplication algorithms."
397,The first point is that the algorithm design space is incredibly rich.
398,Much richer than you might have had initially had intuition for.
399,Multiply two integers.
400,What else could you do with the elementary algorithm?
401,"Well, what have we seen?"
404,looks nothing like what we learned back in grade school.
405,"We will see this over and over again, that with sufficient ingenuity, sufficient cleverness you can solve problems in ways much differently and sometimes much better than using the naive straightforward algorithm."
406,The second takeaway point from this discussion of in teger multiplication algorithms is that sometimes you have interesting algorithmic ideas for which it's totally not obvious what kinds of properties or what kinds of performance guarantees those algorithms enjoy.
408,Which of these three requires the fewest number of cumulative operations to multiply two integers?
410,learned back in elementary school?
411,The answer to that question is totally not obvious and it requires nontrivial mathematical analysis to answer.
412,"In the upcoming lectures, I will provide you with the tools to not only precisely understand and answer this question but more generally, to predict the running times of an entire genre of divide and conquer algorithms like Karatsuba multiplication."

485,Episode #57 The most common jeongseok
486,Today we are happy to be able to present you a lecture created by Baek Jihee.
487,"She's a 2dan professional, currently studying for her Masters in Baduk, in Korea."
488,She's studying at the Myongji University.
489,In 2003 she became professional.
490,And in 2010 she was promoted to 2dan professional.
493,"Let us look at the continuations for both white and black, after this joseki is being played."
495,D for white is a bad move.
496,Which is quite surprising.
498,"It's a surprising move, so you might want to try it out to surprise your opponent."
499,"We're going to study how to handle these moves as white, and we're also going to look at how black can play after this joseki, if white plays tenuki."
500,So let's start with this move.
501,This move is famous because it is often played by Lee Changho 9dan professional.
503,And we will have a look later at why it is a good move.
504,Black can answer with a knight's enclosure.
505,And white will approach on the upper side.
507,Black plays high here on the 4th line because he already has a low stone at A on the 3rd line.
508,This makes a good balance.
509,In go you often want to try to make waves.
510,"Maybe also in other things than go, but waves are good in go."
511,One stone high and one stone low.
512,"After this, this jump for white is a nice point."
513,"If white does not play this move, then black has a nice combination."
515,Black will use the combination of 1 and 3 to also flatten the lower white side.
517,Let's have a look at another position.
519,Because this will help white to become stronger at the lower side.
520,White will hane here and black has a weakness at A to worry about.
521,He still has to come back.
522,"Instead, in this kind of position, there is a surprising move which is this one."
527,"If we go back a bit to this position, we saw that white can approach the upper right corner."
529,"White can approach here, aiming to play at A later."
530,Playing here starts a bit of a complicated variation.
531,Let's begin with the simple variation first.
533,This is a very simple and clear move.
535,So this is certainly possible for black.
536,"However, [this] starts a bit more complicated variation."
537,White has 2 options after this.
538,White can either play here..
540,Let's have a look at the cut first.
541,"Black has to reinforce for his two stones, and white extends..."
543,"Mind that white does not have to make the exchange of [1] for [2], because it is sente anytime."
545,What we mean is: when black tries to capture this stone..
549,"If black plays the cut now, he makes a mistake."
550,White will force black into a bad shape by playing atari here and then blocking on this side.
551,"This block becomes sente for white, because otherwise white will go through at [1]"
553,"So instead of cutting immediately, first black has to push."
554,"If white extends, black will cut anyway."
555,This is good.
557,Black will answer with this strange move.
558,"Eventhough it's an empty triangle, it's a good move because A and B are miai."
559,When white defends here the cut works again for black.
560,"And if white protects the cut, then black will create some aji in white's position."
562,Black will play on the second line.
563,If black omits this move then white can play [this] move and destroy a lot of black's territory.
564,"When white plays [here], we've seen that black plays the keima."
565,"But if black plays somewhere else, white will approach this corner."
566,It's a nice placement for white.
567,This is why [this] is a good move for black.
568,When white approaches here..black is a little bit cramped.
569,White will play on the second line here and white is happy.
570,Black feels under pressure.
571,In [episode #5 Payback time] we've seen this shape.
573,White has this tough spot.
574,After this white will hollow out the corner.
575,And black is in a lot of trouble.
577,"However, black doesn't have a solid base."
579,"Now that we have seen what happens when white plays [here], let's have a look at [this] move."
580,Why is this such a bad move?
581,"It's quite surprising that it's bad because it looks like white is doing good moves, and he's making territory."
583,Right.
585,It's a painful invasion.
586,Black can still live inside white's territory.
587,Black can live because he has [this] aji.
588,This helps a lot in combination with the black stone at [A].
589,Let's see how black can link these stones.
590,Black destroys all of white's territory and is happy.
592,"Yea, it looks like a solid or strong move."
593,But in fact it's not good.
594,[This] move is very urgent because it prevents white from invading at the 3-3 point.
598,After black got the lower right corner he also succeeded in reducing white's framework.
600,"Instead of defending here, white can also consider defending the lower side."
601,"However, this is actually quite small because black has very good endgame here."
602,White's territory is not that big.
604,"The last possibility for white, after black plays [here], is to simply play tenuki."
605,"However, this leaves a very big hole here."
606,"Black will invade, giving white a very hard time."
608,White has a very thin shape.
609,So now we've seen that this is a bad move for white.
610,How about approaching from [this] side?
611,This one?
613,Yes!
614,White can also approach from here.
615,Black answers normally.
616,But now this is a very big point.
617,And this is the reason why Lee Changho chooses to play [this move].
618,Ah.
622,"It's also a possibility, however, it gives white the chance to choose between the normal joseki - playing at [A] - and approaching the corner at [B]."
623,This would be normal but now white can also play [here] to strengthen his own group in the lower left.
624,And to attack the black group.
625,So this would be a nice move.
626,So that's why black [doesn't] play here.
627,He doesn't want to give white the chance to play [here].
628,"So black attacks, himself, immediately."
631,"Black has two ways to answer to this invasion, which is the only move for white."
633,Oh!
634,"We have not seen this one before, right?"
637,And black will play on top.
638,So black also links up.
639,And black seems to gain a lot of thickness on the outside.
640,"After black makes this thickness, maybe white should go out?"
641,Right.
645,Because white still needs to live.
646,"Yes, white's group doesn't have two eyes yet."
647,"Also, black gets major influence here."
648,It's too good for black.
649,"So instead of going up here, which was one possibility, black can also choose to play [here].."
650,"However, we added a few stones.."
651,"Black needs to have a stone at [A] and at [B], but the stone at [A] is crucial because there will be a ladder."
652,"And if black has all these stones, then [this] will become a very powerful move."
653,Black can cut here and then link up on the 1st line.
654,"And white can not capture the [triangle] stone, because the ladder will be good for black because of the stone at [A]."
655,How about when black does not have these 2 stones in place..
656,When black [then] will play this move.. .. white can link up his stones.
657,[This] ofcourse is not a good move.
659,And white will be in trouble.
660,"But instead of this, white sacrifices one stone."
662,"Since white didn't have big territory in this area anyway, black didn't gain much in these exchanges."
663,Let's see another overall board position.
664,Here white has nice shape on the lower side.
665,"[This], in this case, is an excellent move to expand white's framework."
668,"Instead of calmly answering, if black plays tenuki, white can play [here]."
669,This is the sente move that white can use in a lot of situations.
670,Black has to respond and now white made himself a little bit stronger in the area.
671,White also has a move available which is [gote].
672,"This move was [sente], but when white will play here it is [gote]."
674,So black will not answer this move but afterwards white can take away all the territory of black in the corner.
675,And gain a lot of thickness on the outside.
676,Black will have to live very small.
677,"So when you're white and you play [this keima], it has some benefits but also some demerits."
678,Because it is a [gote move].
679,Let's have a look at another position.
680,"White can also approach from this side, instead of playing this keima."
682,Especially when the white shape in the lower side is good.
683,Playing like [this] will make the white territory solid.
684,So this is a mistake by black.
685,White is happy.
686,Instead black can consider just playing [here].
687,This is a move that we've seen before and it's quite simple but effective.
691,Now let's finish with a kind of fun move.
692,Let's have a look at this one.
693,A tricky move!
694,Yes.
695,"The idea is ofcourse that when black extends here, white can cut."
696,He was dreaming of this!
697,Yea.
698,This is beautiful for white.
699,So instead black can try to capture the white stone.
700,This looks like a very natural move.
702,White can cross-cut here!
703,And he can capture the stone and come back on the lower side.
704,In this case white got something on both sides.
706,So white's trick move was successful.
707,"So how about instead of pulling back [here], why not capture this stone?"
708,"Yes, this looks also normal, but then white can give atari and stretch on the 3rd line."
709,"It's also good for white, because black is very flat."
712,"The best white can do is play hane, but he forces black to go through."
713,The black stone at [B] is a little bit painful.
716,We hope you liked this first lesson made by Baek Jihee.
717,And we also hope that you will consider subscribing to BadukMovies Pro.
718,So that we can bring you more episodes made by her.
719,See you next time!
720,music
721,"As you may recall, writing a Deux Ex episode sort of sent James on a bit of a sci-fi kick ."
722,"So, this week we're gonna be doing some more of that."
723,"I'll be up front with you, today's topic doesn't have much to do with games, but it is something that shows up in games a lot."
724,Especially the sci-fi ones
725,Today's topic is Technobabble.
726,"It's sort of the hallmark of mediocre science fiction in any medium, and it's something we should be able to avoid when making games, mostly because it's never necessary."
729,So let's talk about sci-fi for a minute.
730,There are two main camps for what we now call sci-fi.
731,Science fiction and future fantasy.
733,One vauguely rooted in fact with an internally consistent logic.
736,"They didn't always use things perfectly, but they tried to have a grounding in science, and used that to help them examine societal structure in a humanity with faster-than-light capability."
737,Star Trek gives a rosy view.
738,"It's clearly born of a '70s ideology, but they attempted to keep it grounded within the vaguely possible."
739,"Going so far as to create subspace, to invent a realm where they could break the physical laws, as they needed to."
740,"Better examples would probably be some of Aurthur C Clarke's work, or the work of Jeffery Landis, but that's harder to put side-by-side with Star Wars, so yeah."
742,"In this type of science fiction, advanced technology stands in for magic, and allows the characters to do whatever is necessary in order to move them through an interesting plot, or explore the more nebulous, social, and philosophical ideas the designer wants the player to explore"
743,The original Star Wars films are great examples.
744,"They rarely bother with the technological explanation for what's going on, because it doesn't serve the core purpose of the piece."
745,"Taking time to explain all that might kill the story's pacing, and would do nothing to further our emersion in the world, so they don't even bother."
748,"That's why!"""
749,and move on.
750,"The explanation rarely has anything to do with science, but it doesn't need to."
751,That's not he point of the story or the world they are trying to present to us.
752,"When creating sci-fi, both of these approaches are totally valid."
753,They can both lead to exciting stories and provide us a canvas to explore things relevant to our real lives today.
755,"Here's an example, ""midichlorian counts""."
756,"For all it's importance to the series, the Force was never fully explained in the original trilogy."
757,"Now I ask you, ""did you care?"""
758,Of course not.
761,They haven't given enough reason to buy it.
762,"No amount of ""sciencey"" rationalizing is going to help that suspension of disbelief, so tying it to something that the audience vaugely understands as science saying,"
764,"And linking it to our modern understanding of genetics isn't going to solve the fundamental, underlying suspension of disbelief problem."
765,What I'm saying is that you can't lend credibility to your story just by using science words.
768,"Once you've got that underpinning, you can explore all of the interesting things that shake out of it."
770,Don't hamstring it by entangling it in a web of pseudo-jargon.
772,"Now we got a few more minutes here, so lets do something a little, snicker"
773,Extra.
774,It seems to me that relativistic physics is the branch of science most often abused in sci-fi.
775,"Now this may be because relativity was the first time physics radically departed from our perceptual reality, and thus is, sort of, semi-mystic to a lot of people anyway."
776,"Or, it may be because Einstein was really the last guy to capture the public imagination with physics, and so, much of the terminology from relativity has trickled down and is sort of recognizable to a sci-fi audience."
778,"So, to wrap things up today, we're going to give a brief run-down of relativistic terms that come up a lot."
779,"Now, I should start by saying, none of us are physicists."
781,likely that some of you know this stuff better than we do.
782,"The explanations I'm about to give barely skim the surface, and are extremely over-simplified in a lot of places."
783,"Still, for anyone watching who is not a physicist, Hopefully this will begin to clear up what some of these terms actually mean."
784,"So when a game or movie tries to throw one of these at you, you can call them on it."
785,"First up, ""quantum""."
786,"""Quantum"" just means ""a discreet amount""."
787,"You can think of it as ""an indivisible quantity."""
788,"The reason why we call it ""quantum mechanics"" is because it's a branch of physics that treats light both as continuous wave and as coming in discreet definable packets, or"
789,'quanta' of energy.
790,"Look up the photoelectric effect if you wanna dig more into that ""quanta"" of light idea."
791,"Next, ""Brownian motion""."
792,"In the 19th century, a fellow by the name of Brown noticed that pollen particles floating in water would move erratically."
793,Later it was discovered that this macroscopic movement was the result of the microscopic forces from the collision of atoms and molecules within the pollen.
795,But it's often used to describe any random-seeming event that's actually controlled by a large number of rational micro-events.
796,"""Spacetime""."
798,Once you accept that relative velocity can affect relative expereiecne of time that an atomic clock running on a fast-moving spaceship will run slower than an atomic clock here on Earth.
799,Then that means how you travel through time is effected by how you travel through space.
800,"So they need to be mathematically, directly connected somehow."
802,"Which is where we get, ""spacetime""."
803,"Next, inertial mass."
804,"Once you get to relativity, you need to stop thinking of mass being a quantity of stuff, and start thinking about it as, simply meaning, resistance to being accelerated, or, inertia."
805,"Thus, inertial mass."
806,"And finally, ""curvature of spacetime""."
809,And that makes sense.
810,"After all, that's how we experience the world."
811,"But much in the same way that thinking about the world being flat is wrong, even though for the majority of our daily lives, it might as well be."
814,"In fact, the curvature of spacetime is really a way to just stop conceiving of gravity as its own, unique force."
816,"If we think in terms of our flat geometry, we percieve the sun to be exerting a gravitational force that makes the Earth orbit in a curve but in curved spacetime, the Earth actually traves in a straight line"
818,"This is useful, as it helps us understand why even massless things like"
821,"We have to use a more advanced, non-euclidean geometry to calculate the stuff accurately"
822,"So, for example, traveling in a straight line, through such a distortion might still result in a curved trajectory."
823,Even though you never altered your course.
825,Thanks again to all of the physicists who helped us fact-check this.
827,"If nothing else, I hope this is at least shown how much digging and research can be done before you can start throwing these terms around."
828,"Either way, I hope you all enjoyed the science."
830,See you then.

860,I'd like to welcome all the students who want to come to India.
861,We have a lot of expectations for India but Jaipur is a great place to take off point and we hope you to give you an experience to remember for always.
862,Welcome to India!
865,I'm a senior and I'm double majoring in
866,Global Studies and Political Science.
868,I go to the University of Minnesota and I study Pre-Law.
871,I also chose this program because
873,That's an experience that I think really shapes just how everyday life is going to be because you get to experience a culture firsthand.
874,It's way easier having an outlet and some people who
875,"live here who I can talk to who know American students, who've been doing this for a long time and they have the conections with people in society."
876,They take us places that I wouldn't know of on my own.
878,We are taking Hindi and right now it's spilt up into beginners and advanced.
879,"For the advanced, which is what I'm in we've been going out to the markets a little bit and our teacher has been pushing us to converse with people here."
882,"The third class is kind of a course analysis so we've been given a background of India, a history of Rajasthan, the state we're in and then next week we start a class on our internship phase."
883,So we picked a track.
884,We haven't started that yet but it will more of a smaller three to four people one on one with the teacher.
885,My host family is great.
886,I have a mother and her husband who works for the government so he actually is stationed four hours away.
887,We have two siblings who are seven and eight a boy and a girl and we also have our grandfather living with us.
888,I love talking with my mom every night and during meals it's a lot of fun.
890,It's really cool to be in a family because there is a lot of similarities but there is a lot of differences too so it's interesting to see how people on
891,literally on the other side of the world live.
892,It's usually not a nuclear family.
893,"Here it's like parents, kids, aunts and uncles and grandparents all live together sometimes."
894,Jaipur is like a city on fast forward and condensed.
895,There are just so many people and it's a really ineresting combination of the historical past of India with the boldness of now.
896,"Jaipur is really different from home because here it's a lot louder, there's a lot of people the traffic here is crazy,"
898,I feel like Jaipur has become a second home because I feel comfortable and there's my host family and sometimes they remind me of family back at home.
899,I'm really surprised by how quickly you transform to where you are living.
900,I think a lot of times in the West we look at women for example and we're like if only they stood up for themselves or if they just take off the veil and just go for it but when you're living here you realize that everyone is rational and that there is a reason people have for living the way they do.
902,If you have a taste for adventure and if you are a very open minded person and you're not afraid of having everything you know in your life questioned and challenged then do MSlD and if you want to become a real cosmopolitan to have an idea of life outside of the Western bubble if you wanna know what that is like then you are the person that MSlD is really for.
905,"I believe that it is really important how much we have learned through this project, how incredible organizational skills are needed to arrange a staying for 60 people in Poland."
908,"We believe that this can help us in the future to understand people who we are going to do business with, who we're going to be in contact with not only professionally but also socially."
909,"Cooperation of academic circles and student organizations is crucial as this is the moment when we, as students, are actually able to establish first relationships with the professional world."

989,Welcome to week one of this equine nutrition course.
990,We're going to begin by
991,looking at equine digestive tract anatomy.
993,looking for you to be able to describe the anatomy of the gastrointestinal tract of the horse.
997,"In it's natural environment, the horse will roam over somewhere in the region of 80 kilometers per day, and in that sense, we consider horses as nomadic animals."
998,The horse will graze little and often.
1001,The other aspect of the natural environment of the horse is a social aspect.
1006,"For example, if you're riding down the road and the carrier bag blows out of the hedge, your horse will typically run off and then stop and have a look to see what it's actually running from, so that's the flight aspect."
1009,"language, and therefore, they're very good at picking up our body language, but they do also communicate through vocalization as well."
1010,"So having considered the fact that horses graze on a little and often basis for a considerable amount of the day, we now have to have a think about the types of diets that they're designed to process."
1011,"The gastrointestinal system is set up in such a way to deal with high amounts of low quality forage, as I said, ingested on an almost continual basis."
1012,"So what we're seeing here is, is that the principal diet of the horse should be forage, because that is the type of feed that the gastrointestinal tract has evolved to process."
1013,"Having considered the diet, we also have to think about how we manage horses and how this differs from their natural state, if we think about the stabled horse, this is a huge departure from the natural state."
1016,"Even when we think about horses who are kept out to pasture, these are typically much smaller areas than the horse would encounter in a natural state."
1018,"Not only have we changed the way we manage our horses, we've also changed the way that we use them."
1021,leisure or sport horse.
1023,levels of more energy dense feedstuffs in the diet.
1024,"For example, if we think of the race horse, the race horse has high energy requirements to undertake the level of work that is required, and because of that, we think about the natural diet of the horse which is this low quality fiber that couldn't sustain that level of energy requirement."
1026,"Typically, we've done this through the provision of cereal grains in the diet, for example, oats, barley, and maize."
1027,"Not only have we changed the types of feedstuff, we've also changed the feeding management."
1028,"So where the horse has evolved to eat at an almost continual basis, we've moved away from that towards meal-feeding."
1029,"We'll often feed our horses two large meals in the day, two large meals of cereal grains in a bucket for them."
1031,"Unfortunately, the other aspect that's important to consider is that the amount of grains that we're feeding often over shadows the amount of forage."
1032,"So when we think back to the natural environment of the horse and we know that forage should be the natural component, we've often moving away from this providing much more cereal grains in the diet."
1033,"What we know from a lot of research that's been done is, there is a minimum requirement of forage to maintain gut health and integrity, and that is one kilogram of dry matter of forage per hundred kilograms of live wheat according to the"
1035,"So whilst the intestinal system of the horse has remained largely unmodified, we've actually changed how we're feeding these animals and the types of foodstuffs that we're including in the diet."
1036,"And, unfortunately, we're encountering some problems associated with this and these problems can result in serious health implications."
1037,"Horses can develop a number of disorders such as gastric ulceration, hindgut, acidosis, azoturia, laminitis, and colic."
1038,Some of you may have had horses who've suffered from these disorders.
1039,Some of you may know of horses who've had these problems.
1040,"Perhaps one of the most famous horses who have suffered from laminitis for example, is that of"
1042,"So therefore, in terms of the outcomes from horses, for horses suffering from these conditions, this can range from poor performance due to irreparable damage of the gastrointestinal tract, and in very severe cases, euthanasia of the animal."
1045,"It is also important that we understand the behavioral needs of the horse, so that we can maintain good welfare, and ultimately, we want to develop dietary management regimes that avoid or even overcome this diet-related problems."

1074,"So, in these next few videos, we're gonna continue our discussion of the minimum cost spanning tree problem."
1075,"And I'm gonna focus on a second good algorithm, good greedy algorithm for the problem, namely Kruskal's algorithm."
1076,"Now, we already have an excellent algorithm for computing the minimum cost spanning tree in Prim's algorithm."
1078,"Well, let me give you three reasons."
1079,"So the first reason is this is just a, it's a cool algorithm."
1080,It's definitely a candidate for the greatest hits.
1081,It's something I think you should know.
1082,It's competitive with Prim's algorithm both in theory and in practice.
1084,"The second reason is it'll give us an opportunity to learn a new data structure, one we haven't discussed yet in this course."
1085,It's called the union-find data structure.
1086,"So, in exactly the same way or in a similar way to how we used heaps to get a super fast implementation of Prim's algorithm."
1087,We use a unionfind data structure to get a super fast implementation of Kruskal's algorithm.
1089,"The third reason is, is there's some very cool connections between"
1092,I'll discuss how natural greedy algorithms in a clustering context are best understood as a variance of
1093,Kruskal's minimum spanning tree algorithm.
1094,So let me just briefly review some of the things I expect you to remember about the minimum cost spanning tree problem.
1097,That is a subgraph which has no cycles and is connected.
1098,"There's a path between each pairs of vertices and amongst all potentially exponential many spanning trees, the algorithm is supposed to output the one with the smalle st cost, smallest sum of edge costs."
1101,"that said, Kruskal's algorithm actually extends in a really, just easy, elegant way to the case where G is disconnected."
1102,But I'm not going to talk about that here.
1104,"Now don't worry, Kruskal's algorithm is just as correct."
1105,If there are ties amongst the edge costs.
1107,"Finally, of the various machinery that we developed to prove the correctness of"
1108,Prim's algorithm perhaps the most important and most subtle point was what's called the cut property.
1109,So this is a condition which guarantees you're not making a mistake in a greedy algorithm.
1111,"And remember, the cut property says, if you have an edge of a graph and you could find just a single cut for which this edge is the cheapest one crossing it."
1112,Okay?
1115,So we'll definitely be using that again in Kruskal's algorithm when we prove it's correct.
1117,I think you'll find it very natural.
1119,So the graph has seven edges and I've annotated them with their edge costs in blue.
1120,So here's the big difference in philosophy between Prim's algorithm and Kruskal's algorithm.
1121,"In Prim's algorithm, you insisted on growing like a mold from a starting point, always maintaining co nnectivity, and spanning one new vertex in each iteration."
1122,Kruskal's gonna just throw out the desire to have a connected subgraph at each step of the iteration.
1123,"Kruskal's algorithm will be totally content to grow a tree in parallel with lots of simultaneous little pieces, only having them coalesce at the very end of the algorithm."
1124,"So in Prim's algorithm, while we were only allowed to pick the cheapest edge subject to this constraint of spanning some new vertex."
1126,Kruskal's algorithm we're just going to pick the cheapest edge that we haven't
1127,looked at yet.
1128,"Now, there is an issue, of course, we wanna construct a spanning tree at the end."
1129,"So, we certainly don't wanna create any cycles, so we'll skip over edges that will create cycles."
1132,"Again, there is no starting point."
1133,We're just gonna look at the cheapest edge overall.
1134,So that's obviously this unit cost edge and we're gonna include that in our tree.
1135,Right?
1138,It's a greedy algorithm.
1139,So what do we do next?
1140,"Well, now we have this edge of cost two, that looks good, so let's go ahead and pick that one."
1141,Cool.
1142,Notice these two edges are totally disjoint.
1143,Kay.'
1145,"Now, it just so happens that when we look at the next edge, the edge of cost three, we will fuse together the two disjoint pieces that we had previously."
1146,"Now, we happen to have one connected piece."
1150,"Well, that would create a triangle with the edges of costs two and three, and that of course is a no-no."
1152,"So we skip over the four because we have no choice, we can't pick it, we move on to the five and the five is fine."
1154,"And now we have a spanning tree and we stop or if you prefer, you could think of it that we do, we do consider the edge of cost six."
1156,"And then, for completeness, we think about considering the seven, but that would form a triangle with the edges of costs one and five, so we skip that."
1157,"So after this single scan through the edges in assorted order, we find ourselves with these four pink edges."
1158,"In this case, it's a spanning tree and as we'll see, not just in this graph but in every graph it's actually the minimum cost spanning tree."
1159,"So, with the intuition hopefully solidly in place, I don't think the following pseudocode will surprise you."
1160,We want to get away with a single scan through the edges in short order.
1161,"So, obviously in the preprocessing step, we want to take the unsorted array of edges and sort them by edge cost."
1162,"To keep the notation and the pseudocode simple, let me just, for the purposes of the algorithm, description only, rename the edges one, two, three, four, all the way up to m conforming to this sorted order, right?"
1163,"So, the algorithm's just gonna scan through the edges in this newly found sorted order."
1165,"And now, we're just gonna zip through the edges once in sorted order."
1166,"And we take an edge, unless it's obviously a bad idea."
1168,"And that's it, after you finish up the for loop you just return the tree capital T. It's easy to imagine various optimizations that you could do."
1172,"So just like in our discussion of Primm's algorithm, what I wanna do is first just focus on why is Kruskal's algorithm correct?"
1173,Why does it output a spanning tree at all?
1174,"And then, the spanning tree that it outputs?"
1175,Why on earth should it have the minimum cost amongst all spanning trees?
1176,"That's when we're, once we're convinced of the correctness, we'll move on to a naive running time implementation and then finally, a fast implementation using suitable data structures."

1288,And I want to thank Vijay for the outstanding introduction -- very much appreciate that.
1290,"Now, this is our last stop on a trip where we've been talking about an all-of-the-above energy strategy for America -- a strategy where we produce more oil, produce more gas, but also produce more American biofuels and more fuel-efficient cars, more solar power, more wind power, more power from the oceans, more clean and renewable energy."
1292,(applause)
1293,So if you'd just please take me there.
1294,More clean and renewable energy.
1296,"You know what I'm talking about here, because this school is a national leader in developing new sources of energy and advanced vehicles that use a lot less energy."

1325,I felt like...
1326,(laughter)
1328,"Now, one of the reasons that I've been talking so much about fuel-efficient cars and new sources of energy is obviously because we're seeing another spike in gas prices right now."
1329,Oh.
1335,"Oh, yeah."
1337,"Trapped, lonely, and frustrated."
1338,"Right now, for most people you don't have a choice."
1339,"You know, you're stuck inside."
1340,"So when prices spike, that tax hike feels like a -- or that gas spike feels like a tax hike coming right out of your pocket."
1341,"You don't know how you got there,"
1342,That's part of the reason that we passed a payroll tax cut at the beginning of this year -- so that the average American would get an extra $40 in every paycheck to help offset the price of gas.
1343,But you're there.
1344,(applause)
1345,Yeah.
1347,Yeah.
1351,Like that recently.
1352,This happened this time last year.
1353,Really?
1355,Yeah.
1356,"It has been going on for years, for decades."
1358,"And every time prices start to go up -- especially during an election year -- politicians, they start dusting off their 3-point plan for $2.00 gas."
1359,Oh.
1361,Controlled by one person
1362,"Although this year, they decided it was going to be $2.50."
1363,Who could be so cruel.
1364,(laughter)
1366,This year they decided it was going to be $2.50.
1368,"Now, I don't know where they pick that number, $2.50."
1369,"You know, all you want to do is,"
1370,"Because it could have been $2.40, I guess."
1371,Experience the things that you can't reach.
1372,They could have said $2.10.
1373,"You know, like a baseball game"
1374,They could have said 50 cents a gallon.
1375,Or a--Or a dinner with a pretty girl.
1376,But they all make the same promise.
1378,"They head down to the gas station and they make sure a few cameras are following them, and then they tell you how we're going to have cheap gas forever if you just vote for them."
1379,"Well, i'm--I'm shy."
1380,And it has been the same script for 30 years -- the same thing.
1382,It has been like a bad rerun.
1383,Somehow i--I feel free.
1384,"And when you ask them, what specifically is your -- (audience interruption)"
1385,I feel open.

1408,Show me some courtesy.
1409,I'll be happy to take your book.
1410,But don't interrupt everybody else.
1411,All right?
1412,Okay.
1414,(laughter)
1415,"Go ahead and get that book from him, guys."
1416,He wants to give me a book.
1417,Please feel free to grab it.
1418,You're touting this book -- make sure that you've given it to us.
1419,"All right, now that we've gotten that settled."
1420,(laughter)
1422,That's the solution that you always here.
1423,Prices will immediately come down and all our problems will go away -- like magic.
1425,"First of all, we have been drilling."
1427,"Under my administration, America is producing more oil today than at any time in the last eight years -- at any time."
1428,(applause)
1431,That's a fact.
1433,"Offshore, I've directed my administration to open up more than 75% of potential oil resources."
1435,I just visited New Mexico.
1437,We've added enough oil and gas pipeline to circle the entire
1439,"I just visited one of those new pipelines in Oklahoma, and today I directed my administration to make sure that we cut the red tape in terms of reducing some of these bottlenecks."
1440,"So the problem is not that we're not drilling, or that we're not producing more oil."
1441,We are producing more oil than any time in the last eight years.
1442,That's not the problem.
1444,I'm not drilling in the South Lawn.
1445,(laughter)
1446,We're not drilling next to the Washington Monument.
1447,(laughter)
1449,Audience:
1450,No!
1452,So there are some spots out there that we are not drilling.
1453,"But we're doing so in a way that protects the health and safety of the American people, and protects America's incredible bounty that God gave us -- our resources."
1454,(applause)
1457,So we use 20%; we have 2%.
1459,(laughter)
1460,All right.
1463,We can't simply drill our way out of the problem.
1464,"Even if we drilled every square inch of this country right now, we're going to be relying on other countries for oil."
1465,(applause)
1466,Does anybody here think that's a good strategy?
1467,Audience:
1468,No!
1469,The President:
1470,"Of course, it isn't."
1471,"We shouldn't have to pay more at the pump every time there's instability in the Middle East, which is the main reason gas prices are going up right now."
1473,We should not be held hostage to events on the other side of the world.
1474,This is America.
1475,We control our own destiny.
1476,We forge our own future.
1477,And I will not accept an energy strategy that traps us in the past.
1478,(applause)
1479,We're not going to do it.
1480,"So as long as I'm President, America is going to be pursuing an all-of-the-above energy strategy."
1482,(applause)
1483,"We can build the next-generation nuclear reactors that are smaller and safer and cleaner and cheaper, but we've got to also look at renewable energy as the key to our future."
1486,"We've got to build homes and businesses that waste less energy, and put consumers in control of their energy bills."
1487,Audience Member:
1488,(inaudible) (laughter)
1489,The President:
1492,Right here at Ohio State.
1493,So already we've made progress.
1495,(applause)
1496,That means you'll be able to fill up your car every two weeks instead of every week.
1499,Audience:
1500,Yes!
1503,"To use even less oil, we're going to have to keep investing in clean, renewable, homegrown biofuels."
1505,"And the more we rely on these homegrown fuels, the less oil we buy from other countries and the more jobs we create right here in America."
1506,(applause)
1507,We also need to keep investing in clean energy like wind power and solar power.
1508,"I just visited the biggest American solar plant of its kind, in Boulder City, Nevada."
1509,It's powering thousands of homes.
1510,It put hundreds of local people at work.
1512,"And today, thousands of Americans have jobs because of public investments that have nearly doubled the use of clean energy in this country."
1520,"So all these steps, all these steps have put us on a path of greater energy independence."
1521,Here's a statistic I want everybody to remember.
1522,"Since I took office, America's dependence on foreign oil has gone down every single year."
1523,(applause)
1524,"In 2010, our oil dependence was under 50% for the first time in 13 years."
1526,"Even as the economy was growing, we've made progress in reducing the amount of oil that we have to import because we're being smarter; we're doing things better."
1528,We can keep moving in that direction -- we can keep developing new energy and new technology that uses less oil -- or we can listen to these folks who actually believe that the only thing we can do is drill our way out of this problem.
1529,"In fact, they make fun of clean energy."
1530,"They call the jobs produced by them ""phony"" jobs."
1531,They make jokes about them at their rallies.
1532,"Lately, we've heard a lot of politicians, a lot of folks who are running for a certain office -- (laughter)"
1534,-- they dismiss wind power.
1535,They dismiss solar power.
1536,They make jokes about biofuels.
1537,I guess they like gas-guzzlers because they're against raising fuel standards.
1538,Imagine if these guys had been around when Columbus set sail.
1541,"They don't ask what we can do; they explain what we can't do, and why we can't do it."
1542,And the point is there will always be cynics and naysayers who just want to keep on doing the same things the same way that we've always done them.
1544,"Then we wouldn't have a black President, but we do!"
1545,The President:
1546,"Well, that's true."
1547,(applause)
1548,They want to double down on the same ideas that got us exactly into this mess that we've been in and we've been digging our way out of.
1549,That's not who we are as Americans.
1550,We've always succeeded because we refused to stand still.
1551,We put faith in the future.
1552,We are inventors.
1553,We are builders.
1555,We're Thomas Edison and the Wright Brothers and Steve Jobs.
1557,(applause)
1558,Just want to point that out.
1559,But that's who we are.
1560,That's who we need to be right now.
1561,We can't be afraid of the future.
1562,(applause)
1564,They would rather give $4 billion in taxpayer subsidies to oil companies this year than to invest in clean energy.
1565,Four billion dollars to an industry that's making record profits because of what you're paying at the gas station.
1567,Does anybody think that's a wise use of your tax dollars?
1568,Audience:
1569,No!
1571,We have been subsidizing oil companies for a century.
1572,That's long enough.
1573,(applause)
1574,"It is time to stop a taxpayer giveaway to an industry that's rarely been more profitable, and start making investments in a clean energy industry that has never been more promising."
1576,"Bet on our future, not on our past."
1579,"They can either stand with the oil industry, or they can stand with the American people."
1580,"They can place their bets on the energy of the past, or place their bets on America's future -- on American workers,"
1581,"American technology, American ingenuity, American-made energy."
1582,Audience Member:
1583,Our children.
1586,Our children.
1587,(applause)
1588,That's the choice we face.
1589,That's what's at stake right now.
1590,"And, Ohio, we know the direction that we've got to go in."
1591,Ending these oil subsidies won't bring gas prices down tomorrow.
1595,I don't want folks in the Middle East taking your money out of your pocket because we did not develop the kind of strategies that will sustain our future and our independence.
1596,(applause)
1597,So I need all of you guys to make your voices heard.
1599,Write and email.
1601,Let your members of Congress know where you stand.
1602,Tell them to do the right thing.
1603,Tell them that we can win this fight.
1606,(applause)
1607,We can build an economy that lasts.
1608,We can make this another American Century.
1610,Thank you.
1611,God bless you.
1613,Here's the answer.
1614,It's pretty straight forward.
1615,"If there's only 1 argument, you return it."
1618,And the answer is that all 3 of them would work just fine.
1619,We could make it work in all cases.
1621,"And in each of these cases, the entries in this column are greater than the entries in this column, and so max could do the job."
1622,But it seems to me that the case with tuples is the most convenient.
1623,Here with these integers or reals we'd have to be doing very complicated arithmetic to add things up and then break them apart to make sure we got the right answer.
1624,But with the tuples it's simple.
1625,We just use a comma operator.
1626,"We say start with a 7, add in what we have 4 of a kind in, add in what we have the remaining 1 card of, and that gives you the 3 values, and we don't have to deal with any complicated arithmetic."
1627,"Now, if you aren't familiar with tuples, you might want a little bit of practice to understand how they work."
1630,And the way the evaluation works is you first look at the first element.
1631,"If one of them is greater, then that element is greater."
1632,"If they're the same, then you go on to the second element."
1633,"So in this case, 7 is equal to 7 so we move on."
1634,"9 is greater than 3, and so that means this guy is greater than that guy."
1635,You may have seen a similar type of thing in ordering between strings.
1637,We go left to right.
1639,"They're the same, so we move on to the next character."
1640,E compares to e.
1641,"They're the same, so we move on to the next."
1644,"And here we have an I and a p, and p comes later in the alphabet than l, so help would be greater than hello, or hello would be less than help."
1645,"The same type of idea, and this is known as lexigraphic ordering."
1646,It's so called because lex meaning words.
1647,This is the way that words are ordered.
1648,But we use the same name when we're comparing strings or when we're comparing lists of numbers or lists of any other type of value.
1649,"So, does Gabby Giffords really want to go back to Washington, back where she was once called the most positive person in Congress."
1650,It is exciting.
1651,"Staying upbeat, even during the unsettling campaigns of 2010 when we all watched opposition sometimes become the ?"
1653,?
1654,"After she voted for health care, she faced people in her district calling her a traitor, booing her in town halls."
1656,And you may remember Sarah Palin targeted her district with an ad that had a gun site on it.
1657,Giffords once worried allowed to her husband.
1658,"She said ""someday, I am really worried that someone is going to come up to me at one of these events with a gun"""
1659,But her worry didn't stop her conviction that her job was to try to make democracy work.
1660,"Even after the shooting, she sent a message of courage and unity."
1661,"last august, barely able to walk, she flew across country to cast a vote on the debt ceiling."
1662,"and as she entered, the entire Congress cheered."
1663,She knew them by name.
1665,You said hello Living....
1666,Livinggood she has looked at that disturbing photo of the man arrested for shooting her and so many others.
1668,"It was obvious that he had serious mental issues; if he would have received some treatment, this probably would not have happenend."
1669,Do you ever get angry at what happened to you?
1671,Life life
1672,"Over the past months, her dedicated staff is trying to take care of all constituent needs."
1673,She has had to miss 98% of the votes in the Congress she loves.
1674,"So, today, does she really think she can go back to Washington?"
1675,"No, better...um...I've...oh...sigh..."
1678,"You want to get better better and so you think to yourself, I'll go back to Congress if I can get better."
1679,"Yes, yes, yes."
1681,And that's where you are right now yes yes yes.
1684,Oh...better...stronger...hard...real hard and the book is about that...the courage you need when the life you live is not the life you planned and you learn there have to be many definitions of a beautiful day.
1687,What's the first word you think of?
1688,Brave.
1689,Brave.
1691,(Mark) That's what I think of when I think of you too.
1692,Thank you.
1693,(Mark) Brave and tough tough tough.
1694,tough as nails.
1695,Gabby Giffords and Mark Kelly say they want to thank all of the strangers that have written to encourage her.
1696,They plan to visit the families of those who died when she's ready and has more of the words she wants to say.
1697,"You should also know that her therapist, Dr. Esterbrook sent word to us that she has already made a big leap forward just in the days since we left her."
1698,This man right here  is my great-grandfather.
1699,He's the first cat herder in our family.
1700,"[men whooping, cats meowing]"
1701,Herdin' cats.
1702,Don't let anybody tell you it's easy.
1703,[cats yowling]
1707,Bein' a cat herder's probably about the toughest thing I think I've ever done.
1708,"I got this one this mornin', right here, and if you look at his face, it's just ripped to shreds, you know?"
1709,"You see the movies, you hear the stories;"
1710,I'm livin' a dream.
1713,"It ain't an easy job, but when you bring a herd into town and you ain't lost a one of 'em, ain't a feeling like it in the world."
1715,Whoo-hee!
1716,Alright!
1718,Managing the complexities of the digital economy.
1719,[sizzling]
1721,"We're in luck with the x axes, in both systems we know the x axes match."
1722,Whatever happens with the y and z axes won't affect the x axis value.
1723,So in the second system x will also be 10 .
1724,"In the architect system, z goes up and in the mine craft system y goes up."
1725,That's simple enough.
1727,The height is still 13 in the mind craft system so y will be 13.
1728,"Finally in the architect system, y goes north and z goes south in mind craft."
1730,Since z is going in the opposite direction.
1731,Z must then be negative 24.
1734,"You just continue, revisit, and say,"
1737,Our students are hitting it consistently.
1738,"Maybe we can raise the bar a little bit."""
1741,Yeah.
1743,Imagine a health worker.
1744,SPEAKER 2:
1745,"It's simple, isn't it?"
1746,SPEAKER 1:
1748,SPEAKER 3:
1749,Let's imagine she's--
1750,SPEAKER 2:
1751,Or she's--
1753,Imagine she's a he.
1755,Let's stick with a her.
1756,SPEAKER 1:
1757,What about we call her Flo?
1759,Florence.
1760,SPEAKER 1:
1761,Flo.
1762,SPEAKER 2:
1763,"The thing is, whatever a health worker looks"
1764,"like, whatever she's called, imagine this, she saves lives every single day."
1765,SPEAKER 3:
1766,She's amazing.
1769,SPEAKER 3:
1770,Imagine that dream takes her to the big city.
1771,SPEAKER 2:
1772,You don't have to imagine that.
1773,This is what happens time and time again.
1774,She might get a job at a private clinic or maybe she moves abroad to chase a dream.
1775,SPEAKER 3:
1776,"Look, there she is in London."
1778,She's working in a hospital.
1779,"Now, imagine what's happened to us."
1780,SPEAKER 1:
1781,The people she left behind.
1786,Our children are dying from pneumonia and diarrhea.
1787,SPEAKER 2:
1788,We don't know how to protect ourselves from HlV and malaria.
1791,(ALL) Where is the health worker?
1792,Where is she?
1793,SPEAKER 1:
1794,It's hard to imagine a billion people.
1797,SPEAKER 1:
1798,OK.
1799,Cheer up.
1801,SPEAKER 2:
1803,What would it take to make her stay?
1804,SPEAKER 3:
1805,Imagine investing in her.
1806,Imagine paying her a living wage.
1807,SPEAKER 2:
1808,Imagine giving her quality training that she can pass on and imagine giving her the proper tools for the job.
1809,SPEAKER 3:
1810,Now she's got support.
1811,SPEAKER 2:
1815,We listen to her and we learn.
1816,SPEAKER 3:
1817,She is important to us and we value her.
1822,SPEAKER 2:
1823,She could inspire and train hundreds of others to become health workers like her.
1824,SPEAKER 3:
1825,I could be one of them.
1828,SPEAKER 3:
1829,Each of us could be saving lives in our own communities.
1831,SPEAKER 3:
1832,And then imagine what happens next.
1834,SPEAKER 2:
1836,"A health worker for everyone, everywhere."
1839,Now help us make it happen.
1840,Today's world is different for our children.
1842,The technologies we take for granted or simply don't understand become an integral part of our childrens identities.
1843,These technologies saturate practically every aspect of their daily lives.
1844,This digital bombardment is shaping who they are and who they will become.
1845,We must realize they live in a different world and speak a different language.
1846,"If we ever want to take part in nurturing those who will be the architects of our future, it's up to us to learn that language and step into that world."
1848,So that we may truly understand the
1849,Digital Generation.
1850,The private diary of my cousin who was born in Santa Fe and lives in Toronto.
1851,It reads like this...
1852,August 12th:
1853,"""Today I moved into my new house in Toronto, it's so peaceful here, what a wonderful countryside!"
1856,October 14th:
1857,"""This is the most beautiful thing that I've ever seen!"
1858,The color of the leaves.
1859,"This morning, I went hiking through the forest and I saw a deer, what a lovely animal!"
1860,Showing off its horns
1861,"like a crown, no doubt it's the king of the forest."
1862,Canada is a paradise!
1863,"And to think I suffered for so many years in that hell that is Santa Fe!"""
1864,December 2nd:
1865,"""It snowed last night, I'm so happy."
1866,"I woke up and everything was covered in white just like a postcard, I went out to shovel the snow"
1868,It's so nice to live here!
1869,"The grader passed by, cleaning the street and I had to shovel again."
1870,"I'm so HAPPY!"""
1872,"""It snowed... again when I finished shoveling, the grader passed by and once again the front of my house was all covered in dirty snow"
1874,"Today I called my cousin in Santa Fe and he was going with the family to the Guadalupe waterpark"""
1876,"""Merry Christmas!"
1877,"Here, that white shit keeps falling!"
1879,"I think that jerk from the grader is watching me as soon as I finish, he passes by and covers my front all over again."
1881,December 31st:
1882,"""The douchebag on the news got it wrong again instead of 30 cm of snow it fell 98!"
1883,"Here there's nothing like celebrating the new year, 'cause no one can get out of their house because of the fucking snow!"
1885,"I called my cousin again and that fag didn't want to answer because he was in the pool and I'm sure that later he's going to roast a piglet and I'm here, I can't even get out!"""
1888,I shit on that fucking animal!
1889,Fixing it is gonna cost me a shit load of money!
1892,March 2nd:
1894,"I just want to sell the house so I can get the fuck out of here!"""
1896,"""They took off my cast, the mechanic called and said that the chasis is rotten and it's gonna cost me twice the money, due to the salt that is used to melt the fucking snow!"
1897,"I shit on the car, the snow, the mechanic and the whole population of Toronto!"""
1898,May 15th:
1899,"""I finally sold the house to a damn canadian!"
1901,!
1902,"Tomorrow I go back to Santa Fe, I can't wait to get there so I can enjoy the heat, moisture and mosquitoes as soon as I arrive I'm gonna have a delicious barbecue and then obviously I'm gonna have a drink with my cousin that's what I call life!"
1903,"In case you haven't noticed, I have this incessant predilection for attention."
1905,"Pause for a moment, stare at you, then they'll glare at you adoringly."
1906,"I said, woman, I apologize in advance because I'm not trying to get into your pants."
1907,"I mean, resistance is futile, and I've learned to accept it and smile."
1908,I have no control over unconscious processes because my mind has come to the conclusion that you are an adequate kisser.
1910,"And speaking about dreams,"
1911,"I had dreams of Colosseums, dreams of performing in them and convincing impressionable young women that music and poetry  are like sex, they're intimate."
1913,"Life is too short, grab another beer."
1915,Listen to a Lady Gaga song whilst lounging on your chair.
1916,"Not thinking about anything at all, just the simple things like the pounding of your chest as she comes closer with a smile on her dial, a swing in her hip, and a swagger in her step."
1918,(Applause)

2786,But the present does exist.
2787,"We're in it, now."
2788,"You were just then when you said it, but you're not in it now, you're not in it now, you're not in it now."
2789,You're forever being kicked up the arse by the future.
2790,Are you with me?
2792,"See, I'm in the present."
2793,But I'm not in the present.
2794,I'm in the future.
2795,Exactly.
2797,"I wouldn't even mind, but you don't even 'ave a fuckin' future."
2799,Nobody 'as a future.
2801,"Take a look around you, man."
2802,It's all breaking up.
2803,"Are you not familiar with the book of Revelation of St John, the final book of the Bible, prophesying the Apocalypse?"
2804,Yes.
2805,"As it happens, I'm familiar with all the books of the Bible."
2806,I'm very happy for you
2807,"""He forced everyone to receive a mark on his right hand, or on his forehead, so that no one shall be able to buy or sell, unless he has the mark, which is the name of the beast."
2809,- Six-six-six.
2810,I know about it - Great!
2811,I know about Nostradamus.
2814,"You see, you just can't tell."
2815,Fuck Nostradamus!
2816,I'm not talking about Nostradamus or Mother Shipton or Russell Grant of Mystic fuckin' Meg -
2817,I'm talking about a Holy fuckin' Book!
2818,What can such a specific prophecy mean?
2819,What is the mark?
2821,And every fuckin' bar code is divided into two parts by three markers.
2823,Six.
2824,Six.
2825,Six!
2826,Now what does it say?
2828,"And now, what they're plannin' to do in order to eradicate all credit-card fraud, and in order to precipitate a totally cashless society, what they're plannin' to do, what they've already tested on the American troops, they're going to subcutaneously laser-tattoo that mark on to your right hand or on to your forehead."
2832,"""Wormwood will fall from the sky."
2833,"Wormwood will poison a third part of all the waters, and a third part of all the land, and many, many, many, people will die."""
2835,- No - Chernobyl.
2836,Fact!
2837,"On August the 18th, 1999, the planets of our solar system are going to line up into the shape of a cross."
2838,I don't believe in astrology.
2839,I'm not talking about astrology.
2841,"They're going to line up in the fixed signs of Aquarius, Leo, Taurus, and Scorpio, which just happen to correspond with the four beasts of the Apocalypse, as mentioned in the Book of Daniel."
2845,The game is up!
2846,I don't believe that.
2849,But Man will cease to exist.
2850,"Just like the dinosaurs passed into extinction, the same thing'll happen to us."
2851,We're not fuckin' important.
2854,I'm gonna be here in the future.
2855,What is this fuckin' fixation with the future?
2856,!
2857,"Listen pal, I've got chronic systolic palpitations and acute fuckin' neuralgia!"
2859,"No, you fuckin' can't!"
2860,Let me ask you a question.
2861,Have you ever had the sense that you've lived in a time different from this one?
2862,- What you mean like in a past life?
2863,"- Could be, yeah."
2864,"Yeah, well, in my past life I was dead."
2865,"Ah, well, you see - I wasn't."
2866,"I know I was here in the past, before I was born."
2867,So I know I'm gonna be here in the future after I've died.
2868,I see.
2869,"And in this alternative existence, did you still 'ave the same noxious body odour?"
2871,It's what I believe.
2874,"Oh, I do, Brian."
2875,Yeah?
2877,Do you think the amoeba ever dreamed that it would evolve into the frog?
2878,Of course it didn't.
2880,'Course it fuckin' didn't.
2881,"And just as that froggy could never have possibly conceived of - of Shakespeare, we can never possibly imagine our destiny."
2883,"Yeah but what you're experiencing, as far as I can gather what with all these manifestations of regression and precognition and transmigratory astral fuckin' chatterin's, is just the equivalent of that first primeval grunt."
2884,Because evolution isn't over.
2885,Man isn't the fuckin' be-all and fuckin' end-all.
2887,"If you take the whole of time represented by one year, we're only in the first few moments of the 1st of January."
2889,Only now we're not going to sprout extra limbs and wings and fins because evolution itself is evolving.
2890,"And whereas you, through some process of extra-sensory recall, might imagine that you were some -"
2891,"I dunno, some 17th century little Dutch girl livin' in a windmill in Old Amsterdam, one day you'll realize that you've had not just one or two past or future existences, but that you were, and are, everybody and everything that 'as ever been, or will ever be."
2892,Hang on a minute.
2895,Downstairs you were predicting the end of the world.
2896,Now you're talking about the future.
2898,Easy.
2899,"When it comes, the Apocalypse itself will be part of the process of that leap of evolution."
2900,"Yeah, well, whatever happens, mankind will not cease to exist."
2901,He must.
2902,"By the very definition of Apocalypse, Mankind must cease to exist, at least in a material form."
2903,"What d'you mean, in a material form?"
2904,"Well, 'e'll evolve."
2906,Into something that transcends matter.
2907,Into a species of pure thought.
2913,"Into a universal consciousness,"
2915,Who is.
2916,By the same principle that time is.
2917,You don't believe in God.
2918,'Course I believe in God.
2919,You see...
2921,"Must be, because if God is good, then why is there evil in the world?"
2923,It doesn't make sense.
2924,"But if God is a nasty bastard, then you can say, why is there good in the world?"
2925,Why is there love and hope and joy?
2926,"Well, let's face it, good exists in order to be fucked up by evil."
2927,The very existence of good enables evil to flourish.
2928,"Therefore, God is bad."
2929,"And it doesn't matter how many past or future existences you have, because they're all going to be riddled with grief and anguish and sickness and death."
2930,"You see Brian, God doesn't love you."
2931,God despises you.
2932,So there's no hope.
2933,Mankind is just a component of the device by which the devil creates itself.
2934,You with me?
2935,"You see, what I'm saying, basically, is you can't make an omelette without crackin' a few eggs, and humanity is just a cracked egg."
2936,And the omelette stinks.
2937,Yeah.
2939,And what's through the round window?
2940,'Oo's that?
2942,'Ave you seen 'er before?
2943,Oh yeah.
2944,She's there every night.
2945,"Good-looking young girl, in't she?"
2946,She's all right.
2947,Does she ever 'as fellers up there?
2948,No.
2949,"'Ave you ever seen 'er, like, you know, totally naked?"
2950,Once.
2953,She probably gets a kick out of it.
2954,Like you get a kick out o' watching 'er.
2955,I'm doing no such thing.
2956,"Well, I am."
2957,'Ave your got a 'ard-on?
2958,"No, I haven't, as a matter of fact."
2959,"You wouldn't tell me if you had, would you?"
2960,"No, I don't think I would."
2965,Be good.
2966,"If you can't be good, be careful!"
2968,"Tatty-bye, Bri."
2970,What?
2971,!
2972,Mais il est ou alors?
2973,"Ecoute, je ne sais pas qui vous etes."
2974,What's the fuck's going on?
2975,"Where the bloody hell's Dorfman, the bastard costs me 30 grands already!"
2978,Qu'est-ce qui se passe?
2979,Fuck !
2981,"Oh, I'm sorry, love."

2992,It's cold.
2993,"Listen, I'd better explain myself - you see me brother's working as an insecurity guard in that fuckin' monstrosity round the back, and we can see straight into your room."
2994,It's very nice.
2995,"Anyway, 'e's got 'is boss comin' round."
2997,I'd come and say 'ello to Isadora Duncan.
3000,D'you wanna come in?
3001,Is that all right?
3003,About two inches.
3004,It's nice.
3005,"You've 'ad a few, an't you, love?"
3007,Thought you'd never ask.

4841,"Spencer, jewel wants to know"

4851,I don't know.
4852,"Together with Global Relay, every message that you send through the HootSuite compose box is archived, regardless of what device you're using."

4854,This means that messages from all of your connected social networks are easily reviewable by your company's compliance team and by industry regulators.
4855,"Spencer, how am i gonna break back into prison?"
4856,It's important to note that messages published in stream are not archived as they are not sent through the main compose box.

4858,"To activate Global Relay, contact your account manager, who will turn it on for the first super admin of your organization."

4995,A mediator?
4996,Are you getting it?- what I am speaking.
4997,He's with jimmy's mother.
4998,Maybe you think I'm talking about an action that needs to be taken.
4999,Jimmy's mother?

5001,Bad news.
5002,"All right, father."

5071,"Yeah, yeah."
5072,"An initiative that expects to bring closer together SMEs and universities, and vice-versa."
5073,Forget it!
5074,The objective is that the results of university research reach businesses for their development.
5075,"Y'all try to come in here,"
5076,"""What we're trying to do is to break down the barriers that exist nowadays regarding SMEs who cannot easily get access to the results of universities' research."
5077,We'll kill him dead!
5078,"Then, in the university we do a lot of research, a lot of results could be very interesting for SMEs, but, one way or another, they don't make it to the SMEs."
5079,Help me!
5080,"So, they end up staying in the university, they get pretty dusty, and they remain stuck there... ... we want these results to get into the hands of the SMEs."""

5093,No!
5094,If somebody conducts banking business without the required licence he will be fined up to EUR 50.000.
5095,What was that?
5096,The story behind this is as follows.
5097,They say they have a color tv
5098,In 1999 I was summoned by the Upper Austrian Savings Bank.
5099,For lebradford brown.
5100,"And the director of this bank, Herr Heiter, wanted to reduce my credit line from 12 million Schilling to 7 Million Schilling."
5101,Is that part of the strategy?
5102,I was sure that if I go there and tell him how extremely well our business is going he will revise this decision.
5103,Home shopping club.
5104,Our business was going so well because back then we started with those GEA catalogues.
5105,I used your credit card.
5106,And that was received so well that our sales increased by 40%.
5107,"Yes, yes."
5108,In 1999 we made 5 million Schilling profit.
5109,We did.
5110,It was in October 1999 that I was summoned by that bank manager.
5111,We ordered that.
5112,And he thought it was fun to tell me that owes me no explanation whatsoever when he reduces my credit line.
5113,Captain.
5114,"He can reduce my credit line if he wants, and that's the end of it."
5115,What?
5116,For a while I did not want to believe that my attempt to convince him had been in vain.
5117,What now?
5118,"But then I drove off, really angry."
5119,The governor's mediators are here.
5120,And I resolved that the number one priority in my company was now to become independent from banks.
5121,H-How many mediators
5122,"And becoming independent from banks, back then, meant for me to become free from debt."
5123,Do they think we need?
5124,2003 we cleared off all our debt.
5125,Shit.
5126,And I saw that the business was running well; all balance sheets were positive.
5127,You have no idea...
5128,All warehouses and buildings were paid off.
5129,How much i understand...
5130,I saw this as a sign of highest creditworthiness.
5131,What you're going through.
5132,And then I started to ask friends and relatives whether they wanted to invest part of their savings with my company.
5133,"Oh, look at her, man."
5134,I was willing to pay them the same interest I would have to pay to the bank.
5135,She look like the missing link.
5136,That's 4% interest which we pay every December.
5137,I think she's kinda cute.
5138,"And step by step, the money increased."
5139,"Yeah, you would."
5140,"And with those deposits from our customers, we were able to develop our company really well."
5141,Forget it!
5142,To tell you the result:
5143,No one's coming in!
5144,Between 2003 to today we created 100 jobs in the Waldviertel crisis region.
5145,"Warden toolman,"
5146,"Without these deposits, this would not have been possible."
5147,We're from the governor's office.
5148,"Because due to Basel Il, it has become increasingly difficult for small companies to get money from banks."
5149,"How do you do, gentlemen?"
5150,You can't get money anymore for stock of merchandise.
5151,Agent jackson.
5152,I asked the Raiffeisen banker in Schrems:
5153,"Pay attention, boys..."
5154,Does anybody else want a biscuit?
5155,"""What do you think I should do if we we don't get credit for our expensive stock of merchandise anymore?"""
5156,"Captain, we were"
5157,Why can't you give us credit for that anymore?
5158,Specifically instructed
5159,And he said:
5160,Not to make any promises
5161,"""Well, you could inflate the true value of your stock."""
5162,To the inmates.
5163,Yes please.
5164,We've been told to interrupt the proceedings
5165,And I answered:
5166,might as well.
5167,"""Well, of course I could."
5168,And take over the situation.
5169,But don't you relalize that you are insulting me right now?
5170,"Let me in, goddamn it."
5171,You know that for 20 years I have not manipulated the value of my stock.
5172,What the hell is she doing?
5173,"Just because you now have to follow new regulations, that does not mean you have the right to insult me."""
5174,She's signaling.
5175,But it's like this:
5176,"Well, how she know our signals?"
5177,The bank employees have to follow the regulations.
5178,She ain't no homey.
5179,He can't give me credit for my stock of merchandise anymore.
5180,Steal home?
5181,That meant that the customer deposits become more and more vital to us.
5182,Intentional walk?
5183,"Thanks to these deposits, we could develop the business in ways that would not have been possible with banks."
5184,Go home?
5185,"So over the years, the volume of deposits rose to about a Million EUR."
5186,Let me in.
5187,"In Fall 2008, Lehman Brothers went bankrupt."
5188,That ain't no missing link.
5189,Shortly afterwards
5190,That's jimmy!
5191,"Ergee, a company that used to produce socks and stockings in the Waldviertel region, went bankrupt."
5192,Jimmy!
5193,"And fromt their bankruptcy assets, we wanted to to buy a large warehouse."
5194,Yeah!
5195,"In our magazine,"
5196,It is jimmy!
5197,"I wrote a short notice that we wanted to buy this warehouse, and that there is ""GEA Savings Association""."
5198,"Father, what is she doing?"
5199,"""GEA Savings Association"" is our nickname for the account where our customers make their deposits."
5200,She is doing a special prayer
5201,So I wrote:
5202,That i taught her.
5203,"""If you are interested in financing this warehouse please contact us."
5204,Excuse me.
5205,There is this 'savings association' where you can deposit your money.
5206,We're going to go in.
5207,"Anyway can we after, they, they wanted a few predictions."
5208,"No, look."
5209,"We pay you about the same interest as we would pay to the banks."""
5210,What was the next thing they also want?
5211,Ok.
5212,Many of our investors think that we are the friendlier place for putting their money.
5213,"Uh, they can come in."
5214,Many think we are a save haven.
5215,But only the mother and the father.
5216,So I wrote:
5217,"Jimmy, woman's voice:"
5218,"""I thank you for your trust."
5219,close it.
5220,"Welcome to join us."""
5221,Close it!
5222,"And in no time, we got EUR 500.000."
5223,"Oh, where's my jimmy?"
5224,"With this money, we bought the warehouse and started to renovate it."
5225,Where's my jimmy?
5226,But there were more people who wanted to invest with us.
5227,"Right this way, mrs."
5228,To one of them I replied:
5229,Dworski.
5230,"""Thanks, but we don't need your money right now."""
5231,Ohh... did you see that catch i made?
5232,He answered me:
5233,"Oh, these heels are killin' me."
5234,They want  a spread of expenditure for the contract works  So what we agreed with them is that we will forthwith start sending them client reports  and  I've asked them if they will report back to us whether the client reports are in the form they want them.
5235,"James, what took you so long?"
5236,"Because we feel that the client repor Some within the management team feel that the client reports, as we are proposing to issue them are heavy."
5237,"Oh, i was at the hairdresser"
5238,"""My bank has never said that to me."""
5239,In other words there's too much information in them.
5240,So I asked him:
5241,"So they've agreed to cooperate with us in er putting together a client report or, or, or, or devising client reports which have a minimum of information but the information that they require."
5242,Or i'd been here earlier.
5243,Not the information that we think they require.
5244,Hey!
5245,An and I'd like that team briefing as well.
5246,No hair jokes.
5247,"Cos it's quite disappointing that we actually er agreed that we'd start issuing client reports about two months, and as far as I'm aware nobody started issuing them."
5248,"Oh, this is for you, heavy g."
5249,Leeds North Wes
5250,"God, get me out of these clothes!"
5251,gonna have to wait for the erm
5252,It's so hard to be a woman.
5253,No.
5254,"All right, shut up."
5255,That's done.
5256,Shut up.
5257,That's all done?
5258,I'm gonna keep the nails.
5259,"A a apart from Chris and Bill, I've sat down with all the M S fours an and been through the changes to the appointment contract, and how they now erm form the basis of the er interim client report."
5260,Yeah!
5261,"Th the, the, the interim client report is ready I mean you could use it today."
5262,Yeah!
5263,Erm if that's what people .
5264,Should i keep the nails?
5265,"Er if you like when I go through it with Chris and Bill, I'll you know invite you in and we'll we'll, we'll, we'll ."
5266,Yeah!
5267,you say.
5268,They're you.
5269,Well so in other words you haven't done the bridge office?
5270,"Hey, spencer!"
5271,That's right.
5272,Come here.
5273,Yeah.
5274,"Hey, guys, this is"
5275,Because they weren't available when
5276,"Spencer barnes, my friend."
5277,Yeah.
5278,"Hey, man."
5279,"when I did everybody else and erm I, I"
5280,Good work.
5281,Oh yeah.
5282,You got us in.
5283,I'd like to be in on that.
5284,"You know,"
5285,Yeah.
5286,That debbie's a talented girl.
5287,"Er but  but the report, er the database has now been rationalized in accordance with the paper I've put to you."
5288,"Yeah, she is."
5289,Yeah.
5290,"Oh, she gave me her number."
5291,The appointment contracts and variations have been changed in accordance with the paper I've put to you.
5292,She wanted to make sure you had it.
5293,The sort of Toytown Railway example is now up and running.
5294,Here.
5295,"The interim client report which I showed as, again as an example which I provided you a copy with, is now available."
5296,"Yeah, she--She's a nice lady."
5297,So effectively you've had that information all you've actually got to do is to make sure that the text within the general notes of the
5298,"Yeah, she's good, isn't she?"
5299,Mm.
5300,"Well, you take care of yourself"
5301,database is relevant and then on all open projects your clerks can produce these reports for your project coordinators to sign off.
5302,And try to stay out of trouble.
5303,"The only problem is that the first time you do it for each project if it's a ne if it's a an old project, then we are going to have to put something in  the field which summarizes the total remit for the whole of the group to date."
5304,"Oh, really, man."
5305,Er a and that's a one off exercise
5306,And thanks.
5307,"I, I think we should let old projects run the, run the course frankly."
5308,Look me up when you get out.
5309,Well  you can't do that with bridge projects Jim.
5310,Ok.
5311,Y you can in
5312,I get out in about 20 minutes.
5313,Well no.
5314,"In that case, forget it."
5315,No.
5316,Forget it!
5317,your office but you can't do it
5318,I don't want to see him.
5319,We'll put in large ones but I mean I've got a you know
5320,"Good luck, jimmy."
5321,All right.
5322,"""Please, can we write down your address?"
5323,"But--Oh, here."
5324,We will tell you when we continue to renovate the warehouse.
5325,Out like this.
5326,"Then we will need money again."""
5327,"There you go, spencer barnes."
5328,"And in August 2010, I sent out 150 letters."
5329,Have a good trip.
5330,"In the first week, we got EUR 500.000 in the first week, EUR 300.000 in the second week, in the third week we told people:"
5331,"Bye, jimmy."
5332,"""Please stop sending us money."
5333,"All right, man."
5334,"We don't know how to spend it anymore."""
5335,I'm free!
5336,With those deposits from our customers we were able to renovate this warehouse s-u-p-e-r well.
5337,I'm free!
5338,"Oh, warden,"
5339,It is now the biggest building in Austria that is isolated with sheep's wool.
5340,I never thought i'd get out.
5341,The windows are new.
5342,I didn't know i'd get out of that horrible place!
5343,No.
5344,We built a new wood chip heating.
5345,I thought i'd be there forever.
5346,"And now we heat all our premises, 7000 square meters of factory floors and offices, with EUR 15.000 per year for locally grown wood."
5347,"Before, we used to spent EUR 35.000 on gas on oil."
5348,You're wearing lipstick.
5349,We are so happy about this.
5350,My mom gave me a big kiss.
5351,We feel we are doing exactly the right thing for social change.
5352,Where is your mom?
5353,No.
5354,Oh!
5355,No.
5356,I smell perfume.
5357,No.
5358,Don't be stupid.
5359,a hundred projects that will disappear in three months.
5360,The press is watching.
5361,That's right.
5362,"Thank you, everybody!"
5363,A a and we just let those disappear and evaporate.
5364,"You're welcome, jim."
5365,"Moving out of fossil fuels, into renewable energy."
5366,He's the greatest warden a guy could have.
5367,Away from electricity from fossile or nuclear energy.
5368,"It's just my job, jim."
5369,Yeah.
5370,Will i still be released today?
5371,Towards solar power.
5372,Well...
5373,"There, another wonderful thing happened."
5374,will i?
5375,2500 customers gave us EUR 900.000 to buid a solar power station.
5376,"Of course you'll be released today, jim."
5377,Now the sun gives us twice as much electricity as we need.
5378,"Oh, thank you, thank you, thank you!"
5379,Yes.
5380,So we have made the transition to renewable energy.
5381,"Oh, warden, you're the best!"
5382,"Within ten years, we have created 100 jobs in a crisis region."
5383,All right.
5384,"Don't do that again, please."
5385,We have grown from 30 to 130 employees.
5386,Hi.
5387,"I, I'm not for a minute suggesting that er th that for the small projects that we do that."
5388,"Get out of here, man."
5389,And now the financial market supervisory agency comes and says:
5390,But most of Roger's projects
5391,"""Hey!"
5392,I hope i never see you again.
5393,You are not allowed to do this!
5394,Ok.
5395,"You are doing banker's business without a banking licence!"""
5396,Take it easy.
5397,Now I am really outraged.
5398,What are you doing here?
5399,I won't let them take this model from me!
5400,I figured you'd need a ride.
5401,I will fight for this model.
5402,Heh.
5403,w would need tha that remit.
5404,"Thanks a lot, man."
5405,"A and really the remit is nothing other than something like undertake erm er survey work, design, detailed drawings or the reconstruction or repairs to blah blah blah blah including pre-imposed contract work."
5406,And i needed someone to start the car.
5407,End of story.
5408,"Now, tha t i can do."
5409,Unless we vary and  it i i i we just need to put that in.
5410,Hello?
5411,"A and I can get er Ken  and my clerks to ferret through the old contracts, and all the variations that we've had to date, and come up with a suggested erm latest remit for the project coordinator to approve."
5412,"Spencer barnes, please."
5413,If that's what it wants.
5414,"Oh, mr."
5415,The model that citicens organize themselves and say:
5416,"""We are serious about shaping our living environment!"
5417,Sakamoto.
5418,I mean er that's a service I'm quite happy to offer.
5419,"If we work together, we will succeed."""
5420,"Erm so really you tell me which jobs you're gonna send reports out on,a and erm that you would like that particular field sorting out, and I will get Ken and Amanda and Kerry to er t to get something in there, so that when you pull it off erm you're happy with it or we can then edit it."
5421,I'm glad i found you.
5422,"It then g sets the thing right for the next variation as well, cos you use that variation er use that er latest remit within the subsequent variations to the appointment contract."
5423,"Well, nice to hear your voice, too."
5424,I think this is a really important tool in society.
5425,I've just looked through my notes o of the meeting.
5426,Is the other spencer there with you?
5427,"Ye-Yes, he is here."
5428,"But still, I am glad that there is Anna Doblhofer."
5429,They wanted from us an assurance that we would continue to provide the level of service that we have done in the past.
5430,Good.
5431,She is a legal expert.
5432,Because they were concerned about rumours they'd heard of staff shortages within the C E D G.
5433,The legal situation is as follows:
5434,You two impressed me.
5435,Perhaps we should be a bit more careful about whingeing about losing staff to Regional Railways and
5436,"Well, we enjoyed meeting you as well."
5437,other people.
5438,I want you both to come work for me.
5439,Er a and just get on and bite the bullet and do something about it.
5440,You wanna hire us both?
5441,"And get on and, that's right."
5442,You make a good team.
5443,And get work done.
5444,A team?
5445,But they're pinching them.
5446,"Well, how much did you have in mind?"
5447,ridiculous it's their department that's
5448,I was thinking 25 a month.
5449,25.
5450,"According to §1, sub-paragraph 1, line 1 of the banking law for running a commercial deposit business you need a licence."
5451,Thousand?
5452,"And the things that Heini has been doing qualify as deposit business, from the time onward that this business reached a certain volume."
5453,"Yes, you would head"
5454,"When he used to just make loan agreements with friends and relatives, that was unproblematic."
5455,My american advertising operations.
5456,taking them all .
5457,A year?
5458,Yes.
5459,But now it has reached a certain size and so it qualifies as deposit business.
5460,But if we don't
5461,A month.
5462,But Terry they're the client
5463,A month!
5464,There's a fact of life isn't it?
5465,"Well, of course we're flattered..."
5466,the client.
5467,Yes.
5468,"Well you didn't have to, yeah."
5469,Take it.
5470,"But we didn't have to, what I mean the point is that we didn't have to tell, have to tell them, they already knew."
5471,Take it.
5472,They knew that Ian  had taken er or was about to take some  and they knew that er
5473,But we're gonna need a little time
5474,Yeah.
5475,To think that over.
5476,"But you've got, you haven't got a problem with"
5477,No time.
5478,that old Brian  's gone.
5479,No time.
5480,"but I, I, as I understand it you haven't got a problem with workload."
5481,And he does not have a valid licence for that.
5482,"In fac I, from what I understand is that you've got a problem with shortage of workload."
5483,I know.
5484,Yeah.
5485,Make it.
5486,Well I can't stop their perception of the fact that the staff that are disappearing out of the office come from the P T section.
5487,Take it.
5488,Yeah.
5489,Take it!
5490,Therefore the financial market supervisory agency took action.
5491,We'll get back to you shortly.
5492,So now these administrative proceedings are under way.
5493,Take your time.
5494,We have discussed what steps we will take.
5495,You need a vacation.
5496,There has been a hearing.
5497,Thank you.
5498,But .
5499,We expect that within half a year we will be fined.
5500,Bye.
5501,That's quite sure because the facts that constitute the offence are there.
5502,"What are you, nuts?"
5503,Heini will appeal against this judgement up to the highest leve.
5504,You can't stop it but you can influence it.
5505,Business lesson number one.
5506,"I mean if, if our, if, if we're going around whingeing that  a"
5507,He wants to do this in order to enable other businesses to also use this way of financing.
5508,Never take the first offer.
5509,And to change something about the Austrian law that is very restrictive in this regard.
5510,"Yeah, right."
5511,But we're not.
5512,That's just like baseball.
5513,"shortage of staff, but that was their perception Terry."
5514,Don't swing at your first pitch.
5515,"Their perception was that we, we had a desperate shortage of staff"
5516,Wait a second.
5517,Yeah.
5518,Just one quick second.
5519,and we weren't gonna provide them with the level of service that
5520,"I don't know where the tv came from, sir--"
5521,They got the
5522,"Ok, partner."
