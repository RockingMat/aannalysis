8020453,It's a lot more common than you think.
9560550,That's as clear as it gets!
90601,That's why you look older than you are!
786922,"reporter who knows more than they do, in order to make him talk."
491,Let's have a look at what she has prepared.
492,"This is a common joseki, which you can see, and you all probably know it."
942572,"I hoped you would take my crown for a plaything, and me ah, you laugh, naughty Proserpina me, grim as I am, for a playmate."
494,"Let us start with saying that A, B and C are possible moves for white."
1384943,My correspondence with my husband is more important than I can say.
6742506,"betterment; but such as they stand, and have always stood, alone."
497,"And E for white is a trick play, which is difficult to answer."
7209452,"She's more clever than I am She's more honest than I am,"
7397866,"Impossible as it may sound, experts think there may be... a way to travel through a wormhole... and live to tell about it."
8143340,"You're wasting your charms, such as they are."
2023925,"You 're rained in for the night , and I 'm as glad as I can be ."
502,It looks very slow but it's a good move and a very solid move.
6357494,You're different than they are.
10142191,He ain't any older than they are.
107001,"said he ; `` does he laugh at my unhappiness , and think himself more fascinating than I am ?"
506,This is an easy way to play.
9519610,"- She eats very much, even more than I do."""
10756595,"Now, she's much older than he is, and they went together for years."
9445887,So you're not as dumb as you look.
10052096,"Yeah, as many as you like."
514,"White peeps here but black does not connect, but tries to make his framework bigger."
9568771,I'm just a little busier than he is.
516,"White can't play the hane at A because this move for black, [A], is always sente because black can capture the white group at [B]."
518,"When white already has the [A] stone in place, it is not good for black to push up here."
5865991,"I mean they they're all  er some, some countries which we call demo democracies erm aren't the same as we are, they're"
8946183,Thing is as strong as we are.
11035146,You can't deny that some of the girls are as good as it gets.
523,This is a very nice and solid move for black.
524,And can be played without fear.
525,Next black can aim to play at A or B.
526,It's more or less a miai situation.
528,But white can also use this aji.
6136336,"Oh, I'm much more sorry than you are."
532,That's just playing simply here.
1942036,greater than she could bear.
534,"It's a little bit crude, but after this you can play tenuki as black."
205335,- I might know more than-- more than you think.
10641945,It can't be as bad as you think.
539,Or..cut!
221724,I will ask them if they have seen any princess who is as clever and as handsome as I am . '
467483,"If you'd remember that, and practice it, you'd be better liked than I am, because there is more of you."""
542,And after this white can jump.
4301342,"And speaking of Pokémon much smaller than you think,"
544,So black can not cut white.
9593371,Far less than you deserve.
546,"White can simply push [here], and when black defends..white can connect in sente."
547,"Instead of [this] move, white can also take it more easy and just extend."
548,After this hane it's very tricky and black has to be careful.
2081316,"This action rapidly warms the cold water, which contributes to rising sea levels, as water becomes less dense as it warms."
2818596,"That's high praise for ""Death"" but no more than it deserves."
7430690,You know as much as I do.
552,White got very strong on the outside.
7635492,"His reasoning here, brief as it is, is worth following."
1655338,"You 're taller than I am , I declare ."
5734955,To do that we have to differentiate between the inside of a house and the outside of a house which sounds pretty easy but in some houses and some designs it's not as easy as it seems.
556,"Instead of pushing here, white can also play the hane."
6816299,"Yes, he's quicker than he thinks."
9314853,"No, really, it's a lot harder than you think."
11280934,I'm not as rich as you think.
561,After this it's not urgent for black to save the 2 stones.
2818611,"I say , if they comfort thee , I who was Abbot of Such-zen , will make as many as thou mayest desire ."
10035766,Pop stars are wiser than you think!
1417783,"Oh , he could n't find you without help , smart as he is , '' answered Thorny , incredulously ."
5341751,not everything is as easy as it looks ?
10076726,I haven't seen anyone eat ramen noodles as sexy as you do.
5210683,she's almost as big as you are .
572,If black plays hane it's a little bit dangerous.
576,So instead of playing the hane it's better for black to just jump away.
578,Check out [episode #5] if you're interested.
582,"Yes, the lower side looks quite nice, right?"
584,But black has [this] move!
3318346,"Evelyn, I thinkyou're stronger than you realize."
3400270,Go and make him good as you want.
591,How about jumping to here?
10994255,"She put the key in the latch, proud as you please."
8381009,She was as tough and dedicated as they come.
5284434,"She is also, according to Watterson, the only person Calvin truly fears— certainly she is his equal in sneakiness, and is willing to play as dirty as he does."
595,"If white plays here to protect against the invasion, black will play like this."
596,The [shoulder-hit] is the [vital point].
597,White is flattened.
9675347,- It's more dangerous than you realize.
599,This is ofcourse good for black.
483928,"These children are wiser than we are, and I have no doubt the boy understands every word I have said to him."
2597466,"No one in the whole world is so sensitive as I am , I am quite sure of that . ''"
603,It will be reduced greatly.
344667,You’re more selfish than I am.
10674781,~ So don't make things more difficult than they are!
2097758,And that's about as simplified as we can get.
607,"Black continues at A, B or C to handle the situation."
612,Yes.
8094308,"It's as good as it gets, boss."
221798,"` Have you anywhere seen or heard of the daughter of an emperor , king , or a prince , who is as clever and as handsome as I am , and who would be worthy to be my wife and the queen of my country ? '"
9200234,More than you'd like.
619,He doesn't want to get under pressure as white.
620,Right.
621,"So let's maybe first have a look what happens when black [doesn't] play like this, but plays [here], this is the normal move.."
3097203,"I've got muscles, more than you think."
629,And this also puts pressure on white's group right?
630,Right!
8962679,"And they're not confident, so they try and make you feel as sad as they do."
632,"In this situation, this is a nice move."
635,Right.
636,So white needs to link up.
5276283,This bag is as heavy as she is.
8012415,Eat as much as you like.
642,White needs to go out here.
643,And these are good moves because if white omits [this] move.. .. then black will play this move.
644,"Ah, and it will become sente aswell."
10412678,I suppose this business of acting isn't so easy as it looks.
7258760,"So a serious thing, a lot of people get put off by notation, it looks scarier than it is, there's nothing going on here except for notation at this point."
7209609,And some things are bigger than you are.
893578,"So I, I believe we don't spend anywhere near as much as we should do."
787088,"Here comes another Giant, as strong as you are, to fight with you."""
658,It's very ugly shape.
9478803,But we're busy as it is.
661,And connects underneath.
156309,In a little while he called her to sit beside him ; but this was more than I could bear .
7783062,You ain't so stupid as you look.
666,After black calmly answers.. ..he can later aim at this point.
667,Which is the weak point of white's shape.
5169820,"Erm  you know people know the answers  questions or they've got an idea  material  of your own experience you know a lot more than they do, but it's good technique to throw it back to the group."
10379932,I'm not as wise as you are.
1909406,"those blue waves hide; and this circumstance, slight as it may seem,"
5710495,Hugh has two sisters and a brother and all of them are older than he is.
673,"However, it has a better follow-up."
3875489,"loathsome as he is, the wanton, thoughtless tortures inflicted upon him"
681,And this is also a good move to make the lower side more solid.
2548393,"Also, just by asking Congress, the President shows that he respects them as equals, and is not more powerful or important than they are, like a King would be."
2884266,"Now, the monkeys meet two guys who aren't giving them bonuses; they're actually giving them less than they expect."
7701162,"More than you know, son."
688,After this black can take sente and he can flatten white.
689,"Regarding the joseki in the lower left corner, this is a [vital point] to reduce white's shape."
690,"This is standard way to make shape for black, we've also seen this before."
10052276,"And as amazing as it may seem, you know who else was there?"
11477486,- They're fast and they're fucking stronger than you know.
1450683,"in the Washington area, of course, being as affluent as it is, there are lots and lots of Volvo dealerships down here"
6234811,"As frustrating as it can be, we forget people's names, birthdays, and other things we'd like to remember."
701,But in fact it's not that great.
9093824,She's stronger than you think.
705,And he is solid.
7987905,Stroonger than We are.
710,"So instead of playing this hane, the strange move by connecting [here] immediately, is the [right one]."
711,Surprising.
3211976,"not so old as I am, for I am very, very old, and tonight I feel that"
11436745,"I thought I'd found it, but I guess fitting in can be a lot more complicated than it seems, huh?"
714,"However, white gained a little bit of profit on the left side, compared to white's usual approach at [A]."
715,The two white stones on the left however are also very vulnerable to attack.
8241866,"Burt, this isn't going to be as easy as you think."
10543823,I don't believe in biting off more than i can chew.
9003730,About as good as it looks.

727,"When we use scientific terms wrong, all it does is misinform the portion of our audience that doesn't know what those terms mean, and creates cringe-worthy moments for the people who do."
728,"This violates the main principles of design, all of your decision should serve your audience."
8094423,It's bigger than it looks.
10945239,It's tough when your cake figure is more handsome than you are.
1360603,"These children are wiser than we are , and I have no doubt the boy understands every word I have said to him ."
732,Science fiction is an attempt to deliver a view of a possible future.
10289884,"And now that I know the truth, I know more than ever that you and I are a lot more alike than you think."
734,"It takes what we know of the universe today, and uses it to explore concepts that fall out of that understanding."
735,"Star trek, at least up through next generations, was a great example of this."
3662558,There must be more than you expect.
5276382,"permit a poor, ignorant, coloured man to be more polite than I am?"""
8757986,"It's difficult, it's not as easy as you think."
741,The other type of sci-fi is future fantasy.
7529189,"We're not going to be able to pin down the value of B0, but that's not going to be important as we have, as, as you have been seeing in all examples and applications, the exact value of B0 doesn't really, really matter, and there are some exceptions later on the course but it, it's not important."
746,"And when some explanation is necessary, they give a vague,"
747,"""umm... because technology!"
9765611,Making the shell slide off like this is trickier than you'd think.
7299824,"And I hope that they all succeed, and I hope only that we end being just a wee bit better than they are."
8151793,You look younger than I am.
754,"The danger only comes in when a creator can't commit, and tries to layer vague, ""sciencey"" terms over their work, because they don't feel their audience will be able to maintain the suspension of disbelief otherwise."
8282865,A man your age to be as strong as you are.
3498741,This is more than I can handle.
759,Believing in the force is sort of the price of entry into the Star Wars universe.
760,"If you're participating in something Star Wars, and you can't invest in the Force, you're either pretty much saying that you don't want to be there, or that the creator hasn't adequately framed the Force within their work."

766,"Using real science, and allowing that to be the floor that helps you ground your universe in an internal logical constancy."
767,"That's why science fiction works, not just because it sounds ""sciency""."
4727552,As many as you can get.
769,"Which is what makes science fiction so great, and on the flip side, the limitless freedom that technology provides future fantasy is what allows it to deliver compelling stories and explore such a wealth of ideas."
771,"So yes, that is why technobabble sucks."
9159432,"Yeah, well, this job's not as easy as you are, Princess."
777,Even if many of us don't actually understand it.

4481804,"I want you to look him right in those eyes until the rest of him... is just as dead as they are, understand?"

797,"This one's tough to sum up, but it really just boils down to linking space and time mathematically."
9716511,So you're as guilty as he is.
801,"You have to have some way to equate the two, at least interrelate them."
10109730,And that's absolutely as ridiculous as it sounds.
807,"For most of human history, we thought of a plane as a flat surface."
808,"If you go back to Euclid, who set out the cornerstone logic that would define all of our mathematics up through calculus, you'll find that's essentially how he defined a plane with postulate 5, so that how we've always seen it."
9560871,More than you'd think.
812,Thinking of reality existing in flat planes is also wrong.
813,The spacetime plane of reality is often curved by the gravitational force of massive bodies
7635756,"We need to avoid the temptation, in many ways understandable as it might be, to airbrush or sanitize"
815,"And rather,think of massive bodies distorting the plane of reality."
817,"Which is defined by the distorted spacetime, created by the massive sun."
819,light are still affected by this distortion.
820,All this really means in a sci-fi sense is that we can't rely on our traditional geometry to understand how things work in these sections.

922,Many of these atoms can exist on their own like gold or silver or copper or iron but many of these atoms also can or have to combine with one another to form something called compounds and mixtures that we'll go into later.
923,Now elements are considered what's called a pure substance.
924,They can't be broken down into something simpler.

995,"And now, we're going to move on to consider the specific areas of the digestive system, beginning with the mouth, moving on to the stomach, the small intestine, and then, finishing by looking at the large intestine environment."

1000,"The plants that they will consume will vary, and, but typically, they will be low in quality and high in fiber."
1002,Horses are very sociable animals and they've developed this as a survival skill.
1003,"That's because horses are prey animals, and their natural instinct in the presence of danger is to either run away or to hide."
1004,The fight or flight instinct is present in the horse.
1005,"For those of you who have horses, you will be aware of their response to perceived danger."

1015,"But also removing them from the social aspect of being able to socialize with members of the herd, and also, we're removing the ability for them to graze on an almost continual basis."
590838,"He is much older than I am, but he knows a lot of things about movies, basically, I doubt that there is anything that he doesn't know."
1017,So they're still not getting the ability to roam over these distances and have access to the wide range of plants that they would do if they were kept in a natural state.
959481,"So we came to England, and some time later I married William's sister, with whom I am much more happy than I deserve."

1090,Kruskal's algorithm and certain types of clustering algorithms.
1091,So that's a nice application that we'll spend some time talking about.
11224133,And that kid is as stupid as you are.
1095,"So the input of course is an undirected graph, G and each edge has a cost."
1096,"And what we're trying to output, the responsibility of the algorithm is a spanning tree."
4375623,"And if that is what you want to do, life your glow stick as high as it can go, as high as it can go toward heaven."
6530122,"We call it Domain, and it's as broad as you can get."
1099,"So let me reiterate the, the standing assumptions that we've got through the minimum spanning tree lectures."
1100,"So first of all, in assuming if the graph is connected, that's obviously necessary for it to have any spanning trees."
8143950,We need as many as we can get.
1103,"secondly, remember, we're going to assume that all of the edge costs are distincts, that is there are no ties."
7201873,She's tougher than he is.
1106,"I'm just not going to give you a proof that covers that case, but don't worry, a proof does, indeed exist."
1110,It guarantees that a given edge is indeed in the minimum spanning tree.

6079576,These cups have lasted  they're three years older than you are.
1113,"So, the edge E crosses is cut and every other edge that crosses it is more expensive."
1114,"That certifies the presence of this edge in the minimum spanning tree, guarantees that it's a safe edge to include."
10650711,"Not everyone is as strong as you are, Olivia."
1116,"So as with Prim's algorithm, before I hit you with the pseudocode, let me just show you how the algorithm works in an example."
935005,"He is not half so bright as we are, to be sure; and, for that reason, he needs us to look after his comfort and happiness."

10036329,He's more generous than he looks!
1130,"But other than that constraint, we'll just look at the cheapest edge next in Kruskal's algorithm and pick it if there is no cycles."
1131,So let's look at this five vertex example.
9528426,Zeena says he's already got it as good as she has.
1136,Why not?
1137,Why not pick the cheapest edge?
451703,"She is so funny and dear as she is,"" said Beth, who had never betrayed that she was a little hurt at Jo's having secrets with anyone but her."

1148,"When we look at the next edge, the edge of cost four, we notice that we're not allowed to pick the edge of cost four."
1149,Why?
1151,"We want to span the tree at the end of the day, so we can't have any cycles."
1153,"So when we pick the edge of cost five, there's no cycles, we go ahead and include it."
1155,"That would create a triangle with the edges of costs three and five, so we skip the six."

1164,"So we're gonna call the tree in progress capital T, like we did in Prim's algorithm."
230541,Eve's less dangerous than she seems.
1167,"And here a bad idea means it creates a cycle, that's a no-no, but as long as there's no cycle, we go ahead and include the edge."
5309583,"else, is more than one can tell."
1169,"So for example, once you've added enough edges to have a spanning tree."
1170,"So n - one edges, where n is the number of vertices, you can get ahead, go ahead and abort this for loop and terminate the algorithm."
