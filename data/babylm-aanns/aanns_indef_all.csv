and yours are supposedly itself uh... and that you no longer need people on u what people realize that you don't need them and people just kind of flock to you right it's just it's going from a place the press going for a place of needing this going for a place of loneliness going to scarcity to a place of abundance to please the positivity took place of value giving right to a place of just acp complete abundance and i think that transition is where more people need to go for an infantry it's going to transition more into backpack during ivory optimistic vision of of what's going to happen twenty years and i hope back in twenty years we are progressive enough to where we look at community and what's become and it's become like a self-help movement it's become the mains empowerment movements become men successive it's become the equivalent of feminism you know with about a positive image it's become a movement where men can can can be made they don't have to be ashamed of it a lot of men better in this community and a lot of it out decks vision problems because there is shamed of being a man there seem to be dominate their shamed of their sexuality and they've grown up in this environment where it's back or it's you shouldn't netian express that whole idea of meditation our gender roles are so they now you know that it's like pete no one knows how to be a man whereas their parents are graduation elation was very clear cut right like my dad to this day will not use an umbrella he's like men don't use of rocks right and when i got to the marine corps they're like you don't use a row marie studies arose right like those gender roles are very clear and to find and you know maybe there's a danger that as well but one of things that it does do is it makes you unapologetic about being a man and i think hopefully in twenty years that the community will have kind of influence society innocence ever made a big impact society in the sense that oh will move toward a much more progressive progressive uh... progressive system where people are going to to be much more accepting of new ideas well in the since spring of two thousand nine i've got an email from anthony johnson dream and so i mean you know that that there was this cancelled twenty one to mention formerly the under twenty one convention that haven't been to a lot of speakers and was really but changing your life and that was kind of my philosophy on on how you do you go to pick up and so that was one of the things that really drumming about that well i think what may separate between one convention from other conventions or other events is the scene female is holistic development that theme is not addressing for not just about align or about learning to technique which which are fine but it's about improving yourself it's about working you know on your health it's about working on spirituality on working on wealth on working on you know your social circle working on your lifestyle with all these things sa pigeonhole it's all these things that kinda come together to make an attractive guy and that's not only way to communities uh... moving forward and waited twenty one conventions really kinda behind that but it's where and i think success comes from this community because you can only four other people and more importantly joyously urself for so long and after a while that all that that allusion the stock crumbles honestly then i had no idea that the footage we give them any views of commentary thing else in fact when i gave the speech iran which i think anthony and few of the few guys after work as we had a much break in between nine and i've never getting off stage like dejected and i talk to one of the guys in ice as i said to me and i said was as bad as i thought it was cuz i just feel like miserable failure advisers box that whole thing and i felt like i wasn't getting energy for the crowd as really gotta myself and the guy said no no nos for this is going to like i kinda thought people or burgess portion you know and it wasn't so i A when until well into the restaurant and i heard people talking about then i realized my perception
