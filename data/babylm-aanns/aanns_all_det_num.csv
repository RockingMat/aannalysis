babylm_sents,life of the equal to the value three the cop aspin so that all the constructor did with a wrote into the little places for piak simpy why which means it will go into the memory locations at the computer set aside for it the values two and three any questions about that um... the one thousand tries on that excellent point why there are one thousand over here because the one last thing i didn't actually mentioned is after we set aside the memory for the new points what are we going to do with that point we're going to sign it if you want so here is the critical concept how does the computer nowhere p one and all the information associated with he won it every object lives in an address the way the computer actually is referring to object underneath the hood is by the address at which they lit and so you can think of there are some of the house over here that if you want outside like little kids in the house piak simply wider like all of them children restore integer and i say what how do i know how to access you p one i need your address which is a thousand that's where you live so when i do this new when i create the memory in off the heat it says hey i'm going to sign that over turkey one what's the thing that you're actually signing you're signing the memory address for where p one lives arts starting address and from the starting address to confide everything that lives in one so it's getting store here the study found it is not in a major you don't want to think about like the value one thousands of miniature you want to think of this as the memory address one thousand so it is a little overhead gives e additional information that you keep track so how do we do the next very similar kind of concept we say hey i'm going to create a new point okie i need some more memory into the heap says okay why everything off into a thousand eight was allocated so i mean allocates give you some more space in memory that's enough space to store another point which means i'm going to give you space for your instance variables px if you want your overhead notice this dx in p why are distinct from that kexin life this is the p x imp you watch they really instance variables if you want the second px and key white over here at the instance variables of p two very distinct thing so they have separate memory to store them and same thing when we return value that we're going to sign two key to what we're going to sign is the address it's the beginning of the space that we set aside the memory that we set aside for pty method up you know one thousand seats or one thousand say yes any questions about that and space for the same thing accepted to the heat is going down all those memories are given allocated to a new memory we need requires the keep to keep growing downward funky things right we're going to do a method call so we're going to say p one dot cmu we're going to do a method call when we do a method call what ends up happening is we're going to have some parameters and some local variables which means we're going to have to allocate some memory on the staff for that method call so when we start the map that call what ends up happening and we say hey key one i want you to move yourself by ten comm eleven so what actually happens in memory what happens in memory starting at this point upward is we create a new stack frame remember we talked about stack frame to be said when you call a method it sort of like the previous method of previous place you're running just get suspended we try to create this new frame on top that the contains all the information we drew little boxes for the variables and all that one week itself like tracing palindrome than all that happy news remember that if remember that night yeah what was going on underneath the hood it wasn't just nice and with the time it was nice pictures this is what was going on and meet the hood some memory was getting crated on the stack and that's why we refer to this as a stack frame it's keeping track of that frame of information for the method call and it doesn't on the staff of swatches factory what information goes on the stack frame while you get sent over head for the fact that you're calling a method for the earth is overhead as this first four bikes here you get all the parameters that you're passing to the map and you might say but here in the framers on passing through method or d why in the axe what's this in this thing of about there's a hidden parameter that you didn't know about until now now you know about it when i'm calling to method on a particular object how do i know which object won some actually getting into the details of things i actually called the method on and so when you make a method called on an object the very first thing after the overhead that gets put onto the stack essentially a pointer to the object it's what we are for tourism this point to remember we talked about that this pointer and we said this is basically a way for an object to a flirt with self when it's been called or how does it know how to reply to itself it needs to know where itself that's kinda we are in their own wiser optic need to know where it lives itself because when i write some acted these methods are not yet associate with particular objects that i created once i craved particular objects and call that method on them this method over here needs to know hey we're not doing these modifications on piak simply wife which piak simply why are you referring to that's where this comes in this set hey i'm going to tell you the place where the particular object lives whose method is being called so whatever modifications you make over here you know to make them for the object that lives at this addressed which is why it's called so when you make a method call the first thing you get is the address the particular object that remain the method call on right were making a method called he won in p one lives at of thousand right so if you want to just a thousand so this is the value of thousandth and then i get the parameters in reverse order because the sax going up right i get the axe first then i get do you watch and they were just at the value ten and eleven of the past and and i get copies of those down questions about that this pointer here's a graphics variables and when you can when you add up,1209462,this first four bikes,DT JJ CD NNS,this,first,four,bikes,

career 0:00:10.419,0:00:13.479 which is in some ways tracked the course of world events 0:00:13.479,0:00:16.949 expand about development practice and research into 0:00:16.949,0:00:18.619 development economics 0:00:18.619,0:00:20.800 he spent most of his career by the way 0:00:20.800,0:00:25.049 at harvard university and later at columbia 0:00:25.049,0:00:27.560 sex is pretty well known to the general public 0:00:27.560,0:00:30.190 in part because he spent time associating 0:00:30.190,0:00:32.869 with various movie stars and rock stars 0:00:32.869,0:00:36.260 so jeff sachs really is the economist at a celebrity 0:00:36.260,0:00:37.300 himself 0:00:37.300,0:00:39.699 but we're going to look at another angle of this work 0:00:39.699,0:00:43.610 mainly his impact on the theory and practice of economic development 0:00:43.610,0:00:49.320 if you're thinking uh... facts isn't that the guy i saw with angelina jolie 0:00:49.320,0:00:52.110 that's probably right 0:00:52.110,0:00:55.970 sax first made his name is an economist in the early nineteen eighties 0:00:55.970,0:01:00.230 he wrote a series of papers on international trade exchange rates an 0:01:00.230,0:01:02.730 international policy coordination 0:01:02.730,0:01:05.030 and in the eighties he became tenure at harvard 0:01:05.030,0:01:08.190 as one of the youngest full professors at harvard ever 0:01:08.190,0:01:12.360 if you're interested in reading sax on international trade is a good synthetic 0:01:12.360,0:01:14.479 nineteen ninety-five paper he did 0:01:14.479,0:01:15.729 which is online 0:01:15.729,0:01:16.460 it's called 0:01:16.460,0:01:20.150 economic reform in the process of global integration 0:01:20.150,0:01:24.490 and that paper he talks about by the opening up of economies to trade 0:01:24.490,0:01:29.079 is really is a prerequisite and driver of further policy reform 0:01:29.079,0:01:32.380 but although this work on international trade had a real impact 0:01:32.380,0:01:37.190 it's actually not what sex is best known for today 0:01:37.190,0:01:40.719 sax move more into the public eye in the mid nineteen eighties 0:01:40.719,0:01:42.389 with people living in reforms 0:01:42.389,0:01:45.440 especially the reforms against hyperinflation 0:01:45.440,0:01:49.350 in nineteen eighty five the government of bolivia asked fax if you would come 0:01:49.350,0:01:50.130 down 0:01:50.130,0:01:53.930 and help them with their economy and he came up with a comprehensive 0:01:53.930,0:01:57.670 fairly drastic plan for ending their hyperinflation and reforming their 0:01:57.670,0:01:58.860 economy 0:01:58.860,0:02:02.790 by no means did this plant fix all or even most of their problems 0:02:02.790,0:02:05.850 but it did help the bolivians and the hyperinflation 0:02:05.850,0:02:08.569 an overall it can be judged a success 0:02:08.569,0:02:12.549 it was a form of what later came to be called shock therapy 0:02:12.549,0:02:16.379 plans of this sort were based on tight controls over the money supply 0:02:16.379,0:02:17.689 freeing up prices 0:02:17.689,0:02:21.729 and liberalizing the economy 0:02:21.729,0:02:25.280 sexes connection to the so-called shock therapy continued 0:02:25.280,0:02:29.670 and indeed it intensified as eastern europe started to throw off communism 0:02:29.670,0:02:31.419 in the late nineteen eighties 0:02:31.419,0:02:35.239 at that point it was then necessary to have plans for reform 0:02:35.239,0:02:39.129 sax is added poland and he was very important there as an advisor and it's 0:02:39.129,0:02:43.209 an advisor for dismantling the communist system and moving toward a market 0:02:43.209,0:02:44.579 economy 0:02:44.579,0:02:47.949 again faxes recipes for often fairly drastic 0:02:47.949,0:02:51.879 namely the sense that in economy could and indeed should do a lot of things 0:02:51.879,0:02:52.879 upfront 0:02:52.879,0:02:53.829 very quickly 0:02:53.829,0:02:57.109 to re-establish a market economy right away 0:02:57.109,0:03:00.760 with the passage of time i would judge shock therapy in poland 0:03:00.760,0:03:03.399 actually two has been quite a success 0:03:03.399,0:03:07.450 lately poland has been growing rapidly and it really has joined the community 0:03:07.450,0:03:09.159 of western european nations 0:03:09.159,0:03:11.619 as a more or less equal partner 0:03:11.619,0:03:14.989 in russia the use of shock therapy was more controversial 0:03:14.989,0:03:18.209 because it was accompanied by a series of privatizations 0:03:18.209,0:03:20.130 which led to a lot of corruption 0:03:20.130,0:03:24.359 and redistributed wealth in a manner which many people consider unjust 0:03:24.359,0:03:25.680 in fairness to saks 0:03:25.680,0:03:27.439 these privatizations and russia 0:03:27.439,0:03:29.410 happened after he left the country 0:03:29.410,0:03:31.889 and stop serving there as an advisor 0:03:31.889,0:03:33.890 nonetheless the important point here 0:03:33.890,0:03:39.409 is that shock therapy remains a somewhat controversial concept 0:03:39.409,0:03:43.469 by the way if you'd like to read saxon shock therapy i recommend this piece 0:03:43.469,0:03:45.519 which is available online 0:03:45.519,0:03:49.299 in any case you can already see the tax has been extremely important 0:03:49.299,0:03:55.149 as a practitioner of these science and art of economic development 0:03:55.149,0:03:57.769 moving back to economic theory and research 0:03:57.769,0:04:00.430 sexes had an important piece on what is called 0:04:00.430,0:04:02.379 the natural resource curse 0:04:02.379,0:04:05.229 that resurrected the notion that possibly countries could experience 0:04:05.229,0:04:06.949 growth problems 0:04:06.949,0:04:10.900 precisely because they had natural resources 0:04:10.900,0:04:13.909 natural resource might make the country more corrupt 0:04:13.909,0:04:17.559 or it might make them relied too much on this natural resources 0:04:17.559,0:04:21.209 we consider this argument in more detail in our video unit on 0:04:21.209,0:04:22.780 the natural resource curves 0:04:22.780,0:04:24.779 so i would refer you to that 0:04:24.779,0:04:25.900 needless to say 0:04:25.900,0:04:28.710 sax made important contributions in this area 0:04:28.710,0:04:31.740 and he brought up a new what had been told and at the time 0:04:31.740,0:04:35.509 somewhat it and indeed they 0:04:35.509,0:04:39.260 sacks has been an important researcher on african economic growth 0:04:39.260,0:04:41.849 and why it is

0:04:48.969,0:04:54.050 greater problems with rainfall and also demography africa has an especially high 0:04:54.050,0:04:59.009 use dependency ratio that is a lot of young people who need to be supported 0:04:59.009,0:05:03.429 and africa has many more infectious diseases which need to be worried about 0:05:03.429,0:05:06.620 when you put all these factors together according to saks 0:05:06.620,0:05:09.520 africa faces really some very special burdens 0:05:09.520,0:05:15.270 in attempting to achieve economic growth 0:05:15.270,0:05:20.120 in particular sax cooperative piece called the economic burden of malaria 0:05:20.120,0:05:23.830 which looked closely at just how much malaria held back the economies of 0:05:23.830,0:05:25.080 africa 0:05:25.080,0:05:28.110 the problem of malaria is not only that it kills people 0:05:28.110,0:05:31.980 but also when you're young if you're infected by malaria it stunts your 0:05:31.980,0:05:33.100 physical growth 0:05:33.100,0:05:37.050 it may start your brain growth and it can lead to long-lasting and persistent 0:05:37.050,0:05:38.180 problems 0:05:38.180,0:05:42.479 the importance of infectious disease has been a recurring theme of sexist work on 0:05:42.479,0:05:45.840 africa 0:05:45.840,0:05:49.830 for summary of a lot of sax is thought on this topic i would refer you to his 0:05:49.830,0:05:50.629

jointly with the earth institute at columbia 0:06:11.880,0:06:13.949 and also the united nations 0:06:13.949,0:06:16.519 the idea here is really quite ambitious 0:06:16.519,0:06:19.999 that a sufficiently comprehensive program of foreign aid 0:06:19.999,0:06:23.210 can help targeted villages escape a poverty trap 0:06:23.210,0:06:25.740 and blossom into economic development 0:06:25.740,0:06:27.499 this is occasioned a lot of debate 0:06:27.499,0:06:28.959 and we have an entire video 0:06:28.959,0:06:33.279 just on the millennium villages project and so over for you to

pink that's good judgment day here that's the case that families try to bill is that their judgment as bad a judgment as a cognitive area so now that the plane that they have memory problem and they got impaired judgment that's the diagnostic criteria for dementia the reason that this diagnosis is so prevalent is that physicians have the same problem that we have they like to get paid and for every treatment that they provide they have to have a diagnosis the coincides with that treatment what happens to be the case that what you guys know someone with senile dementia the alzheimer's type it opens the doors to a wide variety of treatments that need no additional diagnostic explanation so that diagnosis becomes a very efficient diagnosis for physicians to use and it's very unusual medicare despite the fact it feels to me that they try to find recent wire services were not medically necessary one of the diagnostic codes that they do allow psychotherapy to be provided for is senile dementia of the alzheimer skype now if it's true indicates that you are serving patients that really have senile dementia the alzheimer's tight and you're providing weekly psychotherapy this would be of the type that they get to meet you for the first time every single week what do you really think you're accomplishing here you know if i have a patient that truly has alzheimer's dementia i mainly with them a couple of times to make sure of the diagnosis and be supportive to the family but i'm going off the case because i don't think psychotherapy is applications for someone with moderate to severe dementia they've got to be another way to do this besides psychotherapy i just don't think it's a patient that medicare does pay fort generally start my progress notes by saying patient was alert naureen at times foreign demonstrated could carry over morning so that i'm documenting that even though the station as an alzheimer's diagnosis it's that special sub-type e_ c_ that they do have carryover working i do think there's some dementia out there it's not nearly as problem as you would think it is do not be swayed by the official diagnosis on the medical record because there will be a number of folks that have an outside worse diagnosis that when you do your revaluation you'll be under convinced that they truly have this so just because you're diagnosed as outside burst over a lot of psychotherapy candidates make your own evaluation diagnostic criteria for depression by the way i really don't need the glasses i'm just using them to sort of get myself into the mood of the topic so understand at least five of the following symptoms have been present during the same two week period and one of the symptoms as either depressed mood or loss of interest or pleasure the other symptoms significant weight loss or gain when not dieting significant defined as more than five percent of body weight now do be aware that sometimes in working with older adults you will be encouraging them to set goals and one of the first goals that they may set is to lose ten pounds and as you look at them it will occur to you that they have a to lose and you say well how do you plan on losing ten counts a one point ee plus an exercise more super so they set out on a goal to lose weight now once this nursing home residents has set out on a goal to lose weight and they've dropped five or six pounds you can expect the facility to step in and assist us by putting them on supplemental feedings appetite stimulants an extra portions now the reason for that is that when your client sets a goal to lose weight and does it they end up on a weight loss sheet and the statement comes in surveys the nursing home finds that there are no weight loss sheet and the state knows why people are losing weight it's because the food is called it's not palatable that's being served at the wrong times so the nursing home gets in trouble for it so anytime you have a client in a nursing facility that sets a weight loss cole make the director of nursing and the dietitian aware of what's going on and cover it heavily in your notes that way when the state comes in and says why is she on the weight loss chic the facility can say i'll because doctor tom helper set a goal to lose weight it's in his notes that that's what's going on and the state will say okay for you that otherwise you got to get your facilities cleared otherwise the facilities are going to fight against the school and then that becomes one more example to your older adult client that sure enough when i try to do something somewhat block slick and its frustrating unisa lichtman learned helplessness we do a wonderful job with older adults teaching them helplessness and then we treated for depression be much smarter to just give you some of their power back that would reverse the depression number four insomnia or hyper sonya nearly every day psychomotor agitation or retardation fatigue or loss of energy feelings of worthless nicer excessive or inappropriate guilt diminished ability to favor concentrate recurrent thoughts of death not just the fear of dying but thoughts of death maybe even suicidal ideation with a suicidal plant also keep in mind that with some older adults there does come a time that they realize this is pretty well over and that may not be depression one of the most rewarding cases i had over the last several years was a client who i had been working with for about six months good businessman had opened and closed a variety of businesses most known for a uh... locker business that he operated for years had a stroke came into rehab hospital ended up in a nursing facility where they continued to throw therapy adding he made some slow gains and then had another stroke cap stroke at some point after about six or seven months physical therapy discharge game it was very clear the odds of him going home we're very slim he called me in one day and he looked at me and he says i trust you doctor column and just want to say something i don't want you to go brandon with this and ended up with me on a bunch of medications for depression but if you think i'm depressed only sell that i don't think i a m doctor tom rhino will good business when i see one and i note that there's some businesses that you need apply all money into to make them work and there's other businesses that you're just wanna bet the good money after pat and you really ought to close them up as i look at myself as a business it's not going to make it and there's no reason for anyone to putting more money into it it needs to be close and you have closed businesses and don't exactly know how to close this that doctor tom harvesting can about the stop eating if i stop

and alligators suny they're sworn enemies the one-time iran helped us over the last ten years was when we went into afghanistan 'cause they want to also wiped out al-qaeda which was one of their top

and yours are supposedly itself uh... and that you no longer need people on u what people realize that you don't need them and people just kind of flock to you right it's just it's going from a place the press going for a place of needing this going for a place of loneliness going to scarcity to a place of abundance to please the positivity took place of value giving right to a place of just acp complete abundance and i think that transition is where more people need to go for an infantry it's going to transition more into backpack during ivory optimistic vision of of what's going to happen twenty years and i hope back in twenty years we are progressive enough to where we look at community and what's become and it's become like a self-help movement it's become the mains empowerment movements become men successive it's become the equivalent of feminism you know with about a positive image it's become a movement where men can can can be made they don't have to be ashamed of it a lot of men better in this community and a lot of it out decks vision problems because there is shamed of being a man there seem to be dominate their shamed of their sexuality and they've grown up in this environment where it's back or it's you shouldn't netian express that whole idea of meditation our gender roles are so they now you know that it's like pete no one knows how to be a man whereas their parents are graduation elation was very clear cut right like my dad to this day will not use an umbrella he's like men don't use of rocks right and when i got to the marine corps they're like you don't use a row marie studies arose right like those gender roles are very clear and to find and you know maybe there's a danger that as well but one of things that it does do is it makes you unapologetic about being a man and i think hopefully in twenty years that the community will have kind of influence society innocence ever made a big impact society in the sense that oh will move toward a much more progressive progressive uh... progressive system where people are going to to be much more accepting of new ideas well in the since spring of two thousand nine i've got an email from anthony johnson dream and so i mean you know that that there was this cancelled twenty one to mention formerly the under twenty one convention that haven't been to a lot of speakers and was really but changing your life and that was kind of my philosophy on on how you do you go to pick up and so that was one of the things that really drumming about that well i think what may separate between one convention from other conventions or other events is the scene female is holistic development that theme is not addressing for not just about align or about learning to technique which which are fine but it's about improving yourself it's about working you know on your health it's about working on spirituality on working on wealth on working on you know your social circle working on your lifestyle with all these things sa pigeonhole it's all these things that kinda come together to make an attractive guy and that's not only way to communities uh... moving forward and waited twenty one conventions really kinda behind that but it's where and i think success comes from this community because you can only four other people and more importantly joyously urself for so long and after a while that all that that allusion the stock crumbles honestly then i had no idea that the footage we give them any views of commentary thing else in fact when i gave the speech iran which i think anthony and few of the few guys after work as we had a much break in between nine and i've never getting off stage like dejected and i talk to one of the guys in ice as i said to me and i said was as bad as i thought it was cuz i just feel like miserable failure advisers box that whole thing and i felt like i wasn't getting energy for the crowd as really gotta myself and the guy said no no nos for this is going to like i kinda thought people or burgess portion you know and it wasn't so i A when until well into the restaurant and i heard people talking about then i realized my perception of it wasn't the same as what everyone else are and what i saw the video i realize like when you're up on stage your evaluation yourself this is very very different i might my biggest critical overall and up but unhappy the way but it turned out unhappy that guy's are getting a lot of them getting a lot of emails about it com and first and foremost i'm really happy that kaisa watching that and their feeling saying like it's changed the way they've seen the community change the way that they're going about things and there they actually have a game plan now they know what they're doing and you know where they're going and it's it's revolutionize i guess there's bought process on how to be good news and that's really my objective i see myself being in the solution for a while onto the

0:00:08.339,0:00:11.439 more recently he moved to new york university 0:00:11.439,0:00:15.030 and he's most famous for being one of the architects 0:00:15.030,0:00:16.800 of new growth fearing 0:00:16.800,0:00:21.730 two more recently he's becoming famous for his work in development economics 0:00:21.730,0:00:23.849 fact for his entrepreneurship 0:00:23.849,0:00:25.640 in development economics 0:00:25.640,0:00:29.189 warned that soon 0:00:29.189,0:00:32.889 rollers most famous papers called and dodges technical change 0:00:32.889,0:00:35.840 this is a monumental paper a foundational paper 0:00:35.840,0:00:37.950 in new growth theory 0:00:37.950,0:00:41.750 and it is led to a huge outpouring of work 0:00:41.750,0:00:43.300 in growth theory 0:00:43.300,0:00:46.490 will be able to discuss the paper and much detail but let me just give you an 0:00:46.490,0:00:48.200 essence of where it came from 0:00:48.200,0:00:50.280 let's remember the solo model 0:00:50.280,0:00:52.449 and this all along all output 0:00:52.449,0:00:55.060 is a function of ages ideas 0:00:55.060,0:00:58.460 and a combination of capital and labor 0:00:58.460,0:01:02.460 now solo made to assumptions about ideas eg 0:01:02.460,0:01:04.630 first ideas were a public good 0:01:04.630,0:01:07.840 who are freely available to anyone in the world 0:01:07.840,0:01:08.900 second 0:01:08.900,0:01:13.659 the growth in ideas was gigs argent studies outside the model 0:01:13.659,0:01:18.470 ideas just kind of accumulated over time 0:01:18.470,0:01:19.780 in some ways 0:01:19.780,0:01:21.500 this is not situation 0:01:21.500,0:01:24.130 terrible assumption particularly the first part 0:01:24.130,0:01:27.860 so lot of ideas already public good so for example 0:01:27.860,0:01:31.590 a force is equal a mass times acceleration the pipetter npr_ news a 0:01:31.590,0:01:32.640 public goods 0:01:32.640,0:01:34.340 available to everyone 0:01:34.340,0:01:37.840 however the second assumption is really problematic 0:01:37.840,0:01:38.970 because 0:01:38.970,0:01:41.570 growth is about new ideas 0:01:41.570,0:01:43.700 and if you look around in the world 0:01:43.700,0:01:48.590 most research and development is produced by for-profit firms 0:01:48.590,0:01:51.929 growth ideas are not coming out of the ether 0:01:51.929,0:01:54.260 they're not just arriving 0:01:54.260,0:01:55.450 magically 0:01:55.450,0:01:58.210 they happen in some places and not in other places 0:01:58.210,0:02:00.030 and they happen for a reason 0:02:00.030,0:02:01.479 the happened because 0:02:01.479,0:02:06.420 most of the time someone is out to make a profit in developed economies 0:02:06.420,0:02:09.360 sixty to eighty percent of research and development 0:02:09.360,0:02:13.439 is privately produced by for-profit firms 0:02:13.439,0:02:17.349 so however made these assumptions for a reason 0:02:17.349,0:02:21.549 he made these assumptions because the made the model much much simpler 0:02:21.549,0:02:26.219 because with these assumptions ideas are freely available literally free 0:02:26.219,0:02:27.619 they're not priced 0:02:27.619,0:02:31.879 that means that capital and labor can be sold in competitive markets 0:02:31.879,0:02:34.450 the candidates receive their marginal product 0:02:34.450,0:02:38.200 the product itself can be sold a competitive markets and the payments to 0:02:38.200,0:02:39.450 capitol labor 0:02:39.450,0:02:43.679 will nicely sum up to exactly equal the price of the product 0:02:43.679,0:02:46.469 sort everything works out beautifully with 0:02:46.469,0:02:49.879 the competitive firms that when ideas are not 0:02:49.879,0:02:51.349 uh... priced 0:02:51.349,0:02:52.279 however 0:02:52.279,0:02:54.240 when ideas are priced 0:02:54.240,0:02:55.350 we have a problem 0:02:55.350,0:02:56.809 let's take a look 0:02:56.809,0:02:59.089 ideas are non rival wrist 0:02:59.089,0:03:03.169 and it cannot be sold in competitive markets because the marginal cost is 0:03:03.169,0:03:04.260 zero 0:03:04.260,0:03:08.769 so the classic example here is the pharmaceutical the first pill cost a 0:03:08.769,0:03:10.040 billion dollars 0:03:10.040,0:03:12.349 the second door cost fifty cents 0:03:12.349,0:03:14.319 that fifty cents 0:03:14.319,0:03:17.749 that can be produced the second film the third the fourth in the fifth 0:03:17.749,0:03:22.329 and the end and the and fill can be produced in competitive markets 0:03:22.329,0:03:24.120 the fifty cents comes from 0:03:24.120,0:03:27.189 payments a kaplan labor which are just enough 0:03:27.189,0:03:31.139 to cover the fifty-cent cost of the product 0:03:31.139,0:03:34.969 that doesn't lead and i think over for producing the formula 0:03:34.969,0:03:37.799 for producing the idea which made the 0:03:37.799,0:03:41.169 pharmaceutical possible in the first place 0:03:41.169,0:03:45.739 so you can't sell pharmaceuticals in competitive markets 0:03:45.739,0:03:46.739 okay 0:03:46.739,0:03:49.330 because that doesn't leave enough left over 0:03:49.330,0:03:53.050 to funded the research and development which went into producing a product of 0:03:53.050,0:03:54.249 the first place 0:03:54.249,0:03:56.999 there has to be some in our police power 0:03:56.999,0:04:00.069 either the monopoly power maybe comes from a patent 0:04:00.069,0:04:03.969 or maybe comes from being first a market or having a trade secret 0:04:03.969,0:04:07.759 or having some knowledge of being able to do things better than other people do 0:04:07.759,0:04:09.929 but you need some monopoly power 0:04:09.929,0:04:13.309 uh... to find to fund these ideas 0:04:13.309,0:04:15.589 ideas also create spillovers 0:04:15.589,0:04:19.840 even when you have monopoly power well the pattern runs out over time 0:04:19.840,0:04:23.020 the idea of the at the idea of self can be copied 0:04:23.020,0:04:24.669 not directly but can be 0:04:24.669,0:04:27.430 uh... uh... the idea comes to be useful 0:04:27.430,0:04:29.599 can still spread around the world 0:04:29.599,0:04:31.089 so what'd romer do 0:04:31.089,0:04:35.060 but what romer ddc_ created a mold growth based on ideas 0:04:35.060,0:04:38.240 which were privately produced by for-profit firms 0:04:38.240,0:04:41.100 in annapolis tically competitive markets 0:04:41.100,0:04:44.639 with spillovers 0:04:44.639,0:04:46.389 in one way that's just 0:04:46.389,0:04:50.399 following the formula bestest doing exactly what we would hope a model 0:04:50.399,0:04:51.300 should do 0:04:51.300,0:04:52.719 but bear in mind 0:04:52.719,0:04:55.370 that everyone knew this was kind of the right way to go 0:04:55.370,0:04:59.700 everyone knew this was the right model but apparel failed to create this model 0:04:59.700,0:05:02.009 samuelson failed to create this model 0:05:02.009,0:05:05.959 solo failed to create this model it wasn't until romer 0:05:05.959,0:05:08.149 that all the knots were tied 0:05:08.149,0:05:12.219 that we have all of these characteristics which we know are true 0:05:12.219,0:05:13.990 that ideas are produced by 0:05:13.990,0:05:18.529 monopolistic firms that idea is a really important in growth 0:05:18.529,0:05:23.150 ideas have spillovers all of these ideas combined in a model 0:05:23.150,0:05:24.369 that was really is 0:05:24.369,0:05:27.219 romer response a prima congressman 0:05:27.219,0:05:31.050 in this paper of nineteen ninety 0:05:31.050,0:05:34.210 i said the model is a real technical achievement 0:05:34.210,0:05:35.439 that's true 0:05:35.439,0:05:39.159 but the really important aspect is that a common solvent on start to think about 0:05:39.159,0:05:41.660 things until we have a model 0:05:41.660,0:05:43.279 and what romer did 0:05:43.279,0:05:46.669 is he put ideas at the heart of growth theory 0:05:46.669,0:05:51.189 and once you do that you start to open up and start thinking about a lot of new 0:05:51.189,0:05:51.919 things 0:05:51.919,0:05:53.650 back in the solo model 0:05:53.650,0:05:56.709 it's all about the economic should capital 0:05:56.709,0:05:59.300 once you have ideas at the heart of the model 0:05:59.300,0:06:02.679 you start thinking about things like patents and intellectual property 0:06:02.679,0:06:04.729 you starting about universities 0:06:04.729,0:06:09.740 bug capital markets like venture capitalists and having a capital market 0:06:09.740,0:06:14.669 strong capital markets have been on two printers can take their firms 0:06:14.669,0:06:16.510 he's talking about human capital 0:06:16.510,0:06:19.450 and whiny might not have enough human capital 0:06:19.450,0:06:20.699 in research 0:06:20.699,0:06:22.949 why research might be under-funded 0:06:22.949,0:06:27.150 because we get spillovers because that's a monopolistic industry 0:06:27.150,0:06:29.560 you start asking yourselves questions about 0:06:29.560,0:06:31.569 why do some ideas 0:06:31.569,0:06:35.680 uh... how do ideas transmit themselves across the world how to be flow across 0:06:35.680,0:06:36.849 the world 0:06:36.849,0:06:38.350 where two ideas begin 0:06:38.350,0:06:40.789 why is it takes some ideas a long time 0:06:40.789,0:06:41.949 to transmit 0:06:41.949,0:06:45.270 and other ideas move across the world quite quickly 0:06:45.270,0:06:47.439 you get a whole new perspective on trade 0:06:47.439,0:06:49.569 and the importance of market size 0:06:49.569,0:06:50.319 as 0:06:50.319,0:06:53.940 generating the incentives to produce rnd_ 0:06:53.940,0:06:55.250 you begin to think about 0:06:55.250,0:06:57.199 differences in times of ideas 0:06:57.199,0:06:58.830 by technologies 0:06:58.830,0:07:02.209 these seem much more amenable to be communicated across 0:07:02.209,0:07:03.479 different countries 0:07:03.479,0:07:04.919 then do rules 0:07:04.919,0:07:08.849 rules by rules i mean things like how do people interact 0:07:08.849,0:07:10.349 rules on boat 0:07:10.349,0:07:13.789 uh... 0:07:13.789,0:07:15.939 rosalie had a greater corporation 0:07:15.939,0:07:17.969 how to

0:07:24.150,0:07:26.930 judges and separated from 0:07:26.930,0:07:29.599 uh... politicians the separation of powers 0:07:29.599,0:07:33.220 much harder to transmit these ideas and have these ideas adopted 0:07:33.220,0:07:36.259 than it is to have ideas about 0:07:36.259,0:07:39.030 how to create an engine for an ample 0:07:39.030,0:07:42.289 you also begin to think about where ideas are current 0:07:42.289,0:07:45.419 what is necessary to create new ideas you think about cities 0:07:45.419,0:07:49.800 you think about density of getting people close together to transmit 0:07:49.800,0:07:51.919 knowledge do you think about networks 0:07:51.919,0:07:53.050 so all of these 0:07:53.050,0:07:56.509 ideas about ideas were introduced 0:07:56.509,0:07:58.250 by the romer model and put 0:07:58.250,0:08:03.630 at the center of grocery bipolar world 0:08:03.630,0:08:07.020 so in the late nineteen eighties romer could produce a number of papers in new 0:08:07.020,0:08:08.249 growth theory 0:08:08.249,0:08:11.389 culminating in this great nineteen ninety paper 0:08:11.389,0:08:14.809 many people thought he was on the tracked for nobel prize 0:08:14.809,0:08:17.830 which he may yet winds are really in my view 0:08:17.830,0:08:20.740 and then something strange happened 0:08:20.740,0:08:22.680 romer disappeared 0:08:22.680,0:08:24.819 or at least it seemed that way too 0:08:24.819,0:08:27.669 many people in the economics profession 0:08:27.669,0:08:29.759 romer actually gave up tenure 0:08:29.759,0:08:31.410 he gave up tenure at stanford 0:08:31.410,0:08:34.610 he took an extended five-year leave of absence 0:08:34.610,0:08:36.000 from stanford 0:08:36.000,0:08:37.220 to do what 0:08:37.220,0:08:39.950 well romer created startup 0:08:39.950,0:08:41.670 he created an applicant 0:08:41.670,0:08:47.880 which long before it became a buzzword that it is now aplia was the beginnings 0:08:47.880,0:08:50.160 of online education 0:08:50.160,0:08:54.980 out there was a homework solution professors could assign quizzes could 0:08:54.980,0:08:59.980 grade all ur homework online could you experiments online in economics they 0:08:59.980,0:09:02.720 could shift a demand curve students could shift in anchorage 0:09:02.720,0:09:04.210 and supply curves 0:09:04.210,0:09:06.060 you know it was a fantastic 0:09:06.060,0:09:09.320 fantastic uh... device 0:09:09.320,0:09:10.730 and very successful 0:09:10.730,0:09:11.459 uh... 0:09:11.459,0:09:15.139 uh... roma ran out the effort that seven years and then so look for a lot of 0:09:15.139,0:09:16.470 money to send age 0:09:16.470,0:09:20.670 out they are still going strong today 0:09:20.670,0:09:23.940 did a rumor leave new growth theory 0:09:23.940,0:09:26.920 did he take the lessons of new growth theory 0:09:26.920,0:09:28.829 the importance of ideas 0:09:28.829,0:09:32.800 the importance of ideas to create new ideas to increase productivity 0:09:32.800,0:09:34.690 in dat apply those lessons 0:09:34.690,0:09:36.500 to a great start up 0:09:36.500,0:09:37.850 i think the latter 0:09:37.850,0:09:42.180 and romer story was not yet 0:09:42.180,0:09:46.620 most recently rumors come up with a startling new idea for development 0:09:46.620,0:09:48.040 charter cities 0:09:48.040,0:09:49.070 what is this 0:09:49.070,0:09:51.140 well let's go back to the problem 0:09:51.140,0:09:54.430 the problem is the iron rule of rules 0:09:54.430,0:09:56.610 well i mean my this is 0:09:56.610,0:10:00.940 that we saw that some rules things like the rule of law things like 0:10:00.940,0:10:04.150 anti corruption things like honesty in government 0:10:04.150,0:10:07.430 these types of rules are hard to transmit 0:10:07.430,0:10:09.240 now why the hard to transmit 0:10:09.240,0:10:13.210 well they may be hard to transmit because the require a lot of interaction 0:10:13.210,0:10:15.000 and a lot of coordination 0:10:15.000,0:10:16.620 it's kind of like getting everyone 0:10:16.620,0:10:20.540 from driving on the left hand side of the road to switch to driving on the 0:10:20.540,0:10:22.190 right-hand side of the road 0:10:22.190,0:10:25.500 everyone must agree to coordinate on the new equilibrium 0:10:25.500,0:10:27.300 and that's really hard 0:10:27.300,0:10:28.940 there may be forces 0:10:28.940,0:10:31.920 you can you do it you know halfway in halfway steps 0:10:31.920,0:10:33.819 he can do it a little bit of the time 0:10:33.819,0:10:35.890 you've gotta go all the way or nothing 0:10:35.890,0:10:37.700 and that is very very difficult 0:10:37.700,0:10:40.300 sweden by the way we actually managed to do this 0:10:40.300,0:10:42.200 in the nineteen seventies 0:10:42.200,0:10:45.740 so in just the same way that it's hard to get people to coordinate 0:10:45.740,0:10:48.130 on switching from the right hand side to that 0:10:48.130,0:10:50.130 left hand side or vice versa 0:10:50.130,0:10:52.419 it may be hard to get people to coordinate 0:10:52.419,0:10:54.520 out of the corruption trap 0:10:54.520,0:10:56.600 once you become 0:10:56.600,0:10:58.769 on known once once the rules 0:10:58.769,0:11:00.320 of helping out your cousin 0:11:00.320,0:11:04.420 of helping out your try member once that rule becomes laid down 0:11:04.420,0:11:07.380 a single person breaking from that rule 0:11:07.380,0:11:10.850 is going to have a really hard time they're going to be squash right back 0:11:10.850,0:11:12.960 down again if you don't help by your cousin 0:11:12.960,0:11:14.560 you can read thrown out of the family 0:11:14.560,0:11:17.780 it's really hard to break out of these coordination traps 0:11:17.780,0:11:19.450 so how do you do it 0:11:19.450,0:11:22.260 told the solution is startups 0:11:22.260,0:11:27.530 or a big push in ideas this is like the big push idea coming back to us again 0:11:27.530,0:11:28.959 but now it's and ideas 0:11:28.959,0:11:30.440 well i mean exactly 0:11:30.440,0:11:33.160 well what i mean what rawr means is 0:11:33.160,0:11:35.550 to start up a new city 0:11:35.550,0:11:38.399 and new city on on occupied land 0:11:38.399,0:11:40.280 with a charter of new 0:11:40.280,0:11:41.870 rules 0:11:41.870,0:11:44.170 toys he has in mind for these new rules 0:11:44.170,0:11:46.640 well he wants the rules to come from outside 0:11:46.640,0:11:48.810 to launched this new equilibrium 0:11:48.810,0:11:52.370 so for example you take a unoccupied piece of land 0:11:52.370,0:11:54.060 in a developed country 0:11:54.060,0:11:55.889 and you would turn on a knockout 0:11:55.889,0:11:57.780 unoccupied piece of land 0:11:57.780,0:11:58.840 over 0:11:58.840,0:12:00.119 to uh... 0:12:00.119,0:12:01.390 uh... canada 0:12:01.390,0:12:03.260 over to great britain 0:12:03.260,0:12:07.280 uh... and have them apply this new set of rules and then have people 0:12:07.280,0:12:09.720 voluntarily enter the city 0:12:09.720,0:12:13.060 voluntarily put themselves under the new set of rules 0:12:13.060,0:12:14.500 hong kong here 0:12:14.500,0:12:16.390 is the classic example 0:12:16.390,0:12:18.870 remember it was hong kong 0:12:18.870,0:12:20.160 which is actually 0:12:20.160,0:12:22.620 completely revolutionized 0:12:22.620,0:12:26.050 and that's what rumors hoping start up a new city 0:12:26.050,0:12:26.940 created 0:12:26.940,0:12:28.490 not only as a 0:12:28.490,0:12:31.550 and in itself is a demonstration project 0:12:31.550,0:12:36.360 new city of ten million people are so operating under completely new rules 0:12:36.360,0:12:39.170 new rules which have been successful elsewhere 0:12:39.170,0:12:41.220 bring them to the new city 0:12:41.220,0:12:44.720 now romer introduced this idea only in two thousand and ten or so it's very 0:12:44.720,0:12:51.100 recent and yet incredibly he's already had some success in pushing the idea 0:12:51.100,0:12:52.600 uh... around the world 0:12:52.600,0:12:55.330 so what still hung juries for example 0:12:55.330,0:13:00.510 has indicated that it will create in fact has created 0:13:00.510,0:13:05.330 unoccupied piece of land where these new rules could be put in place right now 0:13:05.330,0:13:06.020 uh... 0:13:06.020,0:13:08.970 romer is looking for a third party 0:13:08.970,0:13:10.500 to come in and help 0:13:10.500,0:13:14.230 run the new city that canada is one possibility 0:13:14.230,0:13:18.950 he's got the judges from outside also being willing to come in and apply the 0:13:18.950,0:13:20.380 new rules 0:13:20.380,0:13:22.850 now bear in mind here something really important 0:13:22.850,0:13:27.270 and that is that the world is organizing and he really fast rate 0:13:27.270,0:13:31.650 so take india for example a scud eight hundred million people are settled still 0:13:31.650,0:13:36.260 living a rulings instance but it's clear over the next twenty to thirty years 0:13:36.260,0:13:39.960 hundreds of millions of these people are going to be coming to cities many of 0:13:39.960,0:13:41.650 them new cities 0:13:41.650,0:13:44.880 so now is a great opportunity 0:13:44.880,0:13:50.600 to create fresh new cities sees not beholden to the old rules 0:13:50.600,0:13:51.920 cities for example 0:13:51.920,0:13:54.840 were cast would no longer be recognized 0:13:54.840,0:13:56.490 that releases the hope 0:13:56.490,0:14:02.190 will roar be successful who knows but it's a bold idea his revolutionized 0:14:02.190,0:14:05.670 economics education he revolutionized new growth theory 0:14:05.670,0:14:10.010 perhaps this idea is gonna take off as well 0:14:10.010,0:14:13.750 here's a couple places you can find out more about pablo mur 0:14:13.750,0:14:17.860 particularly about this new idea of charter cities a rough roberts hasn't 0:14:17.860,0:14:22.670 excellent interviewer econ talk you can also look at romer sp ted talk 0:14:22.670,0:14:24.960 alone also close to the following 0:14:24.960,0:14:27.570 nicely paul romer is a lot like 0:14:27.570,0:14:29.110 uh... coasts 0:14:29.110,0:14:33.500 tonight coast in the right very much to produce only a handful of papers but 0:14:33.500,0:14:36.580 those papers were absolutely revolutionary 0:14:36.580,0:14:38.580 and romer is the same way 0:14:38.580,0:14:42.380 he hasn't written a lot but he what he has written has been very deep has been 0:14:42.380,0:14:46.980 very fundamental has been much more important than a lot than most other 0:14:46.980,0:14:49.600 work which goes on in economics 0:14:49.600,0:14:54.150 indeed when i think about the economist which of most influenced me 0:14:54.150,0:14:56.650 when i think about the ideas which i 0:14:56.650,0:15:01.210 think about most on an everyday basis which are used to interpret the rule of 0:15:01.210,0:15:02.450 the the world 0:15:02.450,0:15:06.500 ideas which i used to interpret the world a lot of them about growth theory 0:15:06.500,0:15:11.620 about the importance of ideas about trade about markets they're coming from 0:15:11.620,0:15:12.990 paul romer 0:15:12.990,0:15:15.760 so indeed if you want to take a look at my tent up 0:15:15.760,0:15:17.510 taba rocks ted talk 0:15:17.510,0:15:20.970 uh... you'll see that's really an introduction to the ideas of paul romer 0:15:20.970,0:15:22.600 in many ways 0:15:22.600,0:15:23.410 so thanks very much",6387496,the late nineteen eighties,DT JJ CD NNS,the,late,nineteen,eighties,
