and see what you see going on with the lamp shades w bcs quite like a rock where goes up people are infected read like a rock where it goes down people are anemic my mom goes through this on a red blood count and no reason for it all of a sudden her red blood count all drop down to three point nine four point one she gets lethargic she calls me and says i'm just not feeling good i'm going to go to bed for about two weeks and see if i'm feeling better than when you're eighty-seven years old you don't go to bed for two weeks you won't be feeling better you probably won't come out of there walking dangerous keep moving catherine used to say life's great if you don't weaken do whatever you can to stop yourself from weakening going to bed for two weeks doesn't do that finally she happens to going to see ur position for an annual review and they find this percent lower red blood count so position puts royer so she's on iron for a couple of months perks right up and about once a year she tends to go through that they've been sculptor the other day they can't find anything bleeding so who knows what she's losing the red blood count but she does from time to time have a patient right now one of the facilities icm_ uh... weaker etc up with times a month when i'm in town the reason i receive the initial consul is that his wife is on the nursing home site and he was just really interfering with the nurses providing care for her over there so i got a console to try to get him to back off well that's been successful this is a fairly sprite old guy matter fact about six seven months ago we wanted to try to take a train trip to chicago to seize old neighborhood i have some doubt about his ability to do that but i was supportive and i said see if you can't sell your family or well sure enough he couldn't i mean i wouldn't know way what i want to see this man wandering chicago on its own but if someone would've gone within a python was a great idea when you were so the gold of chicago i'll help you get there i come back from the my last trip to texas new mexico and i find out that he's on the nursing home site and i said what happened he just stopped doing he just stop doing for himself we sent to the hospital yet he did have your own track infection we say in the hospital for that but he's back from the hospital they've cleared even this is not doing for himself so i go back to cnn_ i said what's going on in his first armenian just prior to just can't get together to do anything and i said will we want to do with the tiredness to only to endorse it that's ok to be tired which you want to keep him god because you know i mean if you're tired readied all you need me hassling you i mean i'll be supported or whatever you want to do tell me the goal and he says only and keep me in the bottle change this please kick me so he wants to test kit as a setter looking at him he looks an awful hot like my mom when she's having one of her episodes so the lab work horrified i find that his white blood count was eleven point eight they sent him into the hospital on arrival in the hospital just thirteen point one and on discharge from the hospital is twelve point nine which was their evidence that the other articles working his red blood count what's normal five to six and a half okay were making numbers up i think that not a physician i release values it's the ones with the elderly have to worry about his red blood count is he one of the hospital was uh... four point eight in the hospital they draw it again and it's four point one unknown discharge was three point nine okay cisco following falling rbc_ there so i mention this to the nurse the nurses when he was just in the hospital in if they were thought anything needed to be done with that they would have done it really thank not today twenty years ago maybe but not so much today so i said well call the doxie if you'll get another set of cbc complete blood count and maybe get the guy started on some wire okay she calls the doctor docs as yet a good idea let source more blood work in two weeks so it's putting on lasix at the guyana lasix over the next week he's related to the hospital for dehydration he's now setting in a hospital i have no idea what he's rbc_ years but see i'm trying to fulfill up on this to get something done for this guy now this week the word also came back to me that's not good news yeah they have decided that he's in the mic but they think it's probably related the fact that he has a softball size tumor hanging off of the left kidney hoops so that made well also be accounting for the tires you've got a look at lapd work because you may be the only person that's due in part and the reason that i'm harping on the stock is that this is treatable this is treatable this that death sentence if you're overwhelmed in your practice diagnose all of your patients with dementia that will take all the pressure off because no matter what you do doesn't matter anyway that they're gonna progressively get worse in the going to die but if you are all i would like to believe that somebody is going to treat me heavily for this investigate fully for this and accept this only when they have to and that's the way i try to approach things and also keep in mind that it's very difficult to distinguish these even with the most sophisticated means i had a case about six months ago a rehab hospital i doubt you waited this woman i did a lot more neuro psych test in the nine or only do in these cases and then i looked at the family and i said you

back the, the flap of the tent as they go in and they see the tables laid out there, they see the food and the drink, they see the plenty, these men who for weeks have known terrible poverty, there might of been a time earlier on in the siege when a few scraps got thrown over the city wall, when the bins were put out the side of the city of an evening, er they would go there and forage amongst them, but all that had stopped long since and it was only the bits and pieces that they managed to forage for themselves and get for themselves that they'd been eating of late, but here every thing is there for the taking, they rubbed their eyes, they pinched one another to make sure their not dreaming, it really is food and drink in a, in an abundance they couldn't of thought of a few mo hours earlier  one moment they had nothing, the next they've got every thing, what was it they needed, food, the tables would of been laden with it, it was the food, enough food for an army and there's only four of them, did they, were they thirsty, here was drink, here was wine and, and drink in abundance  the rags, the tatters they were dressed in, there were garments and wardrobe full of clothes here for them, did they need money, well the tents were full of the gold and the silver and, and, and valuables, there were a sufficiency, every thing was there  you know the idea that the Christian life is drab and poor is such a terrible false hood, its an iniquitous lie of the devil, the tragedy is that we have actually often made it that way, we have made the Christian faith something drab, something boring, something for old folk er and er you know, people who are, who are, just wanting a crutch because their coming to the end of their natural life and we've made it something drab and dull  listen to what the apostle Paul says when he's writing to Carinthian's in his second letter in chapter eight, he says  you know the grace of our lord Jesus Christ, that though he was rich for your sakes he became poor, so that you through his poverty might be rich, god, he's purpose follows his people, he's not that we've a drab, grey, dull uninteresting life, Jesus said I've come that you might of life, and that more abundant, that in all its fullness   and god has purpose for us, and when Paul is talking about riches there, he's not talking about pounds and pence, he's talking about the richness of the life that we enjoy  its not a case of not doing this and having to do that the other thing, its a case of enjoying life as god purposes it, as god intends it  you know if you don't enjoy your Christian life now, let me tell you your in for a rude awakening when you get to heaven, because the quality of life is not gonna change  the only things that'll change is its la it, it will, it will be in his presence, the quality of life will not change because already now we have received eternal life, he has given his life to us and he hasn't got some other special, you know, super duper life laid up, there's nothing, there's nothing greater ahead, god hasn't got any thing greater for us than what he's already given to us in embryonic form here and now  why if we take on er a, a, a dazzling scintillating new zest and zap when you get to heaven, that life is already given to you and to me know  go back to these four men at the moment, they had never known any thing like this before  this was better than all their birthdays rolled into one, this was the greatest day in their experience and if they would live to be a hundred they would never know another day like this, they were having a tremendous time, it said they, they, they, they went into one tent, listen to what they did, they went into one tent and they, they ate, they drank, they had a party and they carried from there the silver, the gold and the clothes and they went and hid they returned and entered another tent and then they did the same there, they were having a tremendous time, this was a beano to end all beano's, this was the greatest day in their life, they were having a wonderful time  and why shouldn't they, why not  you know there are folk who would, who'd want to make us as Christians er and er, ee, put us into a straight jacket  the bible tells me even the sunsets free, is free indeed  and I don't see any suggestions as I read the New Testament, that first of all the life of Jesus was drab and uninteresting, or that he expects me as his follow to lead a drab, a grey life, oh its not always gonna be a ple an easy life  but that doesn't reduce the, the zest and the excitement in it  but you see the danger is when having a good time is the reason for living and the only reason for it, you see, if god has intervened in our life, if the message of the gospel is true, if god in Christ has taken away your sin and made you in Christ a new creation then you have every reason to enjoy life, in a sense your only able to start enjoying life now, you may have enjoyed some of the things that, that folks suggest that make up life, but they've finished, there gone, what happens when the, when, when the wine has run out, what happens when the parties over, you know all about it the next day, don't you, what happens then, its such short lived, its only worth having whilst its coming to you all the time, but that's not so with a Christian life, because it doe , depend on just the things that we have or the experiences that we go through, because it is something that, that we have within, it is, it is a quality of life that we possess, because we possess the one who is life himself, listen to what Paul says when he's writing to Timothy in his first letter in chapter six  it is command those who are rich in this present world not to be arrogant or to put their hope in wealth, those who think that, that er in having possessions that is the secret of life or, or in having a good time and, and, and the rest of it that is what life is all about, he said warn them not to do that, because that is so uncertain, he says but to put their hope in god who richly provides us with every thing   what for, for our enjoyment, why has god given us these things, why is, why is god even, he is natural creation there for us, it is for our enjoyment, its not to make us miserable or to make us grey and drab and burden by it, it is for us to enjoy, when god created Ada Adam and Eve and put them in the garden, the, they were told to enjoy it, even the fruit enjoy it, its there for your benefit  and then the new creation, every thing that god has provided is there for our enjoyment, but the dangers is when that enjoyment, is the reason for living and that's all we do it for and were so taking up with ourselves, I am gonna have my good time, I'm gonna enjoy myself as a Christian and I can do it and you can do it, you become insular and we become introverted and the only thing that matters is me having a good time, my world centres around me and me enjoying myself and me having this and me having that, this blessing and that gift and that other blessing, we become self centred and taken up with our own good times, as long as I can be there in the centre, as long as I can go from, from, from this celebration to that celebration, as long as I can go from this er festival to that festival to this special meeting to that one, I'm gonna have my good time  well that was what these fella's were doing, they were going from tent to tent, from celebration to celebration having a great time and then the truth hit them  they were ashamed with what they had done, they said to one another we are not doing right, this days a day of good news, but we are keeping silent, if we wait until morning light punishment will overtake us, now therefore, come, let us go and tell the kings household  how guilty are we, how guilty are you, how guilty am I of the sinner silence, remember how we started, its not always the things that we do  its often the things that we don't do, how guilty are we of the sin of silence  these men  had known nothing, known poverty and, and, and, and starvation, they were amazed at what they'd found, they'd became absorbed in what they had got and now they'd became ashamed of what they had done with it  what was the sin that troubled these men  they said we are keeping silent.\n",

just acp complete abundance and i think that transition is where more people need to go for an infantry it's going to transition more into backpack during ivory optimistic vision of of what's going to happen twenty years and i hope back in twenty years we are progressive enough to where we look at community and what's become and it's become like a self-help movement it's become the mains

corps they're like you don't use a row marie studies arose right like those gender roles are very clear and to find and you know maybe there's a danger that as well but one of things that it does do is it makes you unapologetic about being a man and i think hopefully in twenty years that the community will have kind of influence society innocence ever made a big impact society in the sense that oh will move toward a much more progressive progressive uh... progressive system where people are going to to be much more accepting of new ideas well in the since spring of two thousand nine i've got an email from anthony johnson dream and so i mean you know that that there was this cancelled twenty one to mention formerly the under twenty one convention that haven't been to a lot of speakers and was really but changing your life and that was kind of my philosophy on on how you do you go to pick up and so that was one of the things that really drumming about that well i think what may separate between one convention from other conventions or other events is the scene female is holistic development that theme is not addressing for not just about align or about learning to technique which which are fine but it's about improving yourself it's about working you know on your health it's about working on spirituality on working on wealth on working on you know your social circle working on your lifestyle with all these things sa pigeonhole it's all these things that kinda come together to make an attractive guy and that's not only way to communities uh... moving forward and waited twenty one conventions really kinda behind that but it's where and i think success comes from this community because you can only four other people and more importantly joyously urself for so long and after a while that all that that allusion the stock crumbles honestly then i had no idea that the footage we give them any views of commentary thing else in fact when i gave the speech iran which i think anthony and few of the few guys after work as we had a much break in between nine and i've never getting off stage like dejected and i talk to one of the guys in ice as i said to me and i said

me know what the population isn't metal if we have more higher population arthur are standing on the lookout people tend to make decisions to not have children instead of having children this is a lot

people not the selected few anybody want to take this next one will prevent those people in the seat of power programmers manager this except out from corruption or swinging things in their favor i would like to try this one go ahead the question was partially answer with how we can teach compassion empathy children so when we rescued in that way so it would be compassion that will be cooperative in the corporate environment they also will be brought up in the system to check the next fifty twenty don't have scarcity you didn't have to get in nineteen decision of differential advantage when everything available to you everything in abundance you don't even have a fought to acquire something more than two judges you can use almost everything and everything will be available to you and in the same time every other part of the system will be interconnected with other so if you purposely will try to will break something in one part of the system is this will affect you rapid way for example even the programmer or engineer or any person who have solar panel on the roof doesn't make any sense to hacked the own electric grid it doesn't take you anywhere so it will be senseless to actually even think about to see is the power in its admits not going to be stimulated or will not have in a sense to actually it in think about it to take advantage position in that system because when other people yet more availability to resources when children yet proper education could reach ur who aren't the more it as a society as a whole okay thanks venal people right down

this project has a set direction the agenda is already set forth in terms of our goals you know you can read that in the book in terms of common heritage and the well-being of all people rather than just a select few and systems approach to acquiring goods and services to everyone i know elitism so it you speak of comments and and more but it just becomes a procedural system in terms of how you

food housing clothing a compliment probe appropriate environment two enable resources to go for it in terms of cities signs in the way we do things then there is nobody per se in charge of anything

carry on those acts have been abused terribly throughout life your reasons why they do that and you look for the environmental conditions that cause people to do that and you eliminate those conditions whenever there is hunger in scarcity crime goes up so you can call it that with the system people think that some people just criminals there's no such thing tomorrow's world will consider all the supreme court judges as criminals all politicians as criminals because they like continuously megan produced nothing they cannot produce jobs nobody had produced films is increasing purchasing
